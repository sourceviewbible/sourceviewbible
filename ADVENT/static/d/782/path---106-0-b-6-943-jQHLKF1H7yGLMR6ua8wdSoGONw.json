The Pharisees asked Jesus,</p><h1>The Pharisees</h1><h4>Does the law permit a person to work by healing on the Sabbath?</h4><p>(They were hoping he would say yes, so they could bring charges against him.)<br />   <u>11</u>And he answered,</p><h1>Jesus</h1><h2>If you had a sheep that fell into a well on the Sabbath, wouldn’t you work to pull it out? Of course you would. <u>12</u>And how much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Yes, the law permits a person to do good on the Sabbath.</h2><p><u>13</u>Then he said to the man,</p><h1>Jesus</h1><h2>Hold out your hand.</h2><p>So the man held out his hand, and it was restored, just like the other one! <u>14</u>Then the Pharisees called a meeting to plot how to kill Jesus.<br />   <u>15</u>But Jesus knew what they were planning. So he left that area, and many people followed him. He healed all the sick among them, <u>16</u>but he warned them not to reveal who he was. <u>17</u>This fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah concerning him:<br />   <u>18</u>“Look at my Servant, whom I have chosen.<br />   He is my Beloved, who pleases me.<br />   I will put my Spirit upon him,<br />   and he will proclaim justice to the nations.<br />   <u>19</u>He will not fight or shout<br />   or raise his voice in public.<br />   <u>20</u>He will not crush the weakest reed<br />   or put out a flickering candle.<br />   Finally he will cause justice to be victorious.<br />   <u>21</u>And his name will be the hope<br />   of all the world.”*</p><h5>*12:18-21 Isa 42:1-4 (Greek version for 42:4).</h5>","questionsTitle":null,"Questions":null,"prevPath":"/011","nextPath":"/011"}},"pageContext":{}}
