Nazareth is never mentioned in the Old Testament by name. However, the similarly sounding Hebrew root nsr is used in several prophetic passages which refer to the coming messiah.

Each set progresses from dealing with external and concrete actions to addressing the internal issues of the heart.<br/> These instructions reveal where the problem really lies. It lies in the coveting of the human heart. The law is designed to reveal to us our broken condition.

To make a covenant the parties involved would split an animal in half and lay the two parts out on the ground. They would walk together in a figure eight between and around the two halves, stained with the blood of the sacrificed animal. As they did this “blood walk” they would make vows to each other to fulfill their part of the covenantal agreement. And should either party fail to live up to their end of the deal, the other was authorized to do to them what they together had done to the animal. Making a covenant was serious business. It could cost you your life.<br/> One of the first covenants God makes with humans is found in Gen 15:9-12,17-18a (hot link). But there is something surprising in God’s covenant with Abraham. After Abraham butchers the animals in preparation for the covenant ceremony he falls asleep. When he awakes, he sees something very unexpected. He sees God doing the covenant ceremony on his own!

God would never fail; but Abraham (like all of us) certainly did! And instead of putting the covenantal consequences on Abraham (or on us), God took them on himself. Jesus came as God, and he took responsibility for the covenantal failures that were not of his own making. For this reason he was born in Bethlehem’s stable.
