That small word is <i>apo</i>, a preposition which is best translated “away from.” This Greek preposition depicts a visually powerful spatial dimension. It would be used to describe someone who has walked out the front door of a house and has embarked on a journey to take him ever further “away from” the house. With each step he is more distant from his point of origin. And so it is that as we continue on life’s journey, walking with Jesus, his purpose is to lead us ever further “away from” sin, it’s deceitful attraction, it’s ensnaring addiction, and it’s life-destroying consequences. He doesn’t just forgive us our sins and leave us unchanged, living in sin. His salvation is an ongoing journey, in which he distances us from sin, “away from” that which has damaged our relationships with God and others.</p>","ref":"DAY 12","html":"<p>   <strong>Mat 1</strong><u>20</u>As he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. </p><h1>an angel</h1><h4>Joseph, son of David,</h4><p>the angel said, </p><h1>an angel</h1><h4>do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife.

But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate who pleads our case before the Father. He is Jesus Christ, the one who is truly righteous. <u>2</u>He himself is the sacrifice that atones for our sins—and not only our sins but the sins of all the world..<br/>   <strong>3</strong><u>2</u>Dear friends, we are already God’s children, but he has not yet shown us what we will be like when Christ appears. But we do know that we will be like him, for we will see him as he really is. <u>3</u>And all who have this eager expectation will keep themselves pure, just as he is pure.<br/>   <u>4</u>Everyone who sins is breaking God’s law, for all sin is contrary to the law of God. <u>5</u>And you know that Jesus came to take away our sins, and there is no sin in him. <u>6</u>Anyone who continues to live in him will not sin. But anyone who keeps on sinning does not know him or understand who he is...</h10></h3><h1>paul</h1><h3>   <h10><strong>Tit 3</strong><u>3</u>Once we, too, were foolish and disobedient. We were misled and became slaves to many lusts and pleasures. Our lives were full of evil and envy, and we hated each other.<br/>   <u>4</u>But—&quot;When God our Savior revealed his kindness and love, <u>5</u>he saved us, not because of the righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He washed away our sins, giving us a new birth and new life through the Holy Spirit.* <u>6</u>He generously poured out the Spirit upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior. <u>7</u>Because of his grace he made us right in his sight and gave us confidence that we will inherit eternal life.&quot; <u>8 </u>This is a trustworthy saying, and I want you to insist on these teachings so that all who trust in God will devote themselves to doing good.
