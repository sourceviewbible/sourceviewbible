You must listen to him. <u>16</u>For this is what you yourselves requested of the Lord your God when you were assembled at Mount Sinai.* You said, ‘Don’t let us hear the voice of the Lord our God anymore or see this blazing fire, for we will die.’<br/>   <u>17</u>Then the Lord said to me, ‘What they have said is right. <u>18</u>I will raise up a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites. I will put my words in his mouth, and he will tell the people everything I command him. <u>19</u>I will personally deal with anyone who will not listen to the messages the prophet proclaims on my behalf. <u>20</u>But any prophet who falsely claims to speak in my name or who speaks in the name of another god must die.’<br/>   <u>21</u>But you may wonder, ‘How will we know whether or not a prophecy is from the Lord?’ <u>22</u>If the prophet speaks in the Lord’s name but his prediction does not happen or come true, you will know that the Lord did not give that message. That prophet has spoken without my authority and need not be feared.</h3><h5><br/></h5><h1>jesus</h1><h2>   <strong>Joh 5</strong><u>39</u>You search the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life. But the Scriptures point to me! <u>40</u>Yet you refuse to come to me to receive this life.<br/>   <u>41</u>Your approval means nothing to me, <u>42</u>because I know you don’t have God’s love within you. <u>43</u>For I have come to you in my Father’s name, and you have rejected me.

For you gladly honor each other, but you don’t care about the honor that comes from the one who alone is God.*<br/>   <u>45</u>Yet it isn’t I who will accuse you before the Father. Moses will accuse you! Yes, Moses, in whom you put your hopes. <u>46</u>If you really believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about me. <u>47</u>But since you don’t believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?</h2><h5>*Deu 18:16 Hebrew <i>Horeb</i>, another name for <i>Sinai</i>.<br/>*Joh 5:44 Some manuscripts read <i>from the only One</i>.</h5>","questionsTitle":"LEARNING FROM THE PAST","Question1":"With which character do you most identify in this story ?
