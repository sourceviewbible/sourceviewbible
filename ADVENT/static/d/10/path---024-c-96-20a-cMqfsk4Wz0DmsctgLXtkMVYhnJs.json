{"data":{"adventLectionary":{"path":"/024","title":"God Was in Christ Reconciling Us","display":"block","link1":null,"bookName":"1Ti 2:1-7; 2Co 5:11-21","segment":"<p>These two passages clearly state the reason for Jesus’ advent. It’s simple. It’s so that people the world over can be reconciled to God. This was his purpose for coming. This should be our purpose as the followers of the one who came – and who continues to come – into our world. His gracious goal leads us to consider our evangelistic engagement with those around us.<br/>   This theme of reconciliation is at the heart of many Christmas carols. Consider thoughtfully the words of Hark, the Herald Angels Sing:</br><br/>   Hark! the herald angels sing,</br>   “Glory to the new-born King!</br>   Peace on earth, and mercy mild,</br>   God and sinners reconciled.”</br>   Joyful, all ye nations, rise,</br>   Join the triumph of the skies;</br>   With th’ angelic host proclaim,</br>   “Christ is born in Bethlehem.”</br>   Hark! the herald angels sing,</br>   “Glory to the new-born King!</br><br/>   Christ, by highest heaven adored:</br>   Christ, the everlasting Lord;</br>   Late in time behold him come</br>   Offspring of the favoured one.</br>   Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see;</br>   Hail, th’incarnate Deity:</br>   Pleased, as man, with men to dwell,</br>   Jesus, our Emmanuel!</br></br>   Hark! the herald angels sing,</br>   “Glory to the new-born King!</br>   Hail! the heaven-born</br>   Prince of peace!</br>   Hail! the Son of Righteousness!</br>   Light and life to all he brings,</br>   Risen with healing in his wings</br>   Mild he lays his glory by,</br>   Born that man no more may die:</br>   Born to raise the son of earth,</br>   Born to give them second birth.</br>   Hark! the herald angels sing,</br>   “Glory to the new-born King !”</p>","ref":"DAY 23","html":"<h1>paul</h1><h3><h10>   <strong>1Ti 2</strong><u>1</u>I urge you, first of all, to pray for all people. Ask God to help them; intercede on their behalf, and give thanks for them. <u>2</u>Pray this way for kings and all who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives marked by godliness and dignity. <u>3</u>This is good and pleases God our Savior, <u>4</u>who wants everyone to be saved and to understand the truth. <u>5</u>For,<br/>   There is one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity—the man Christ Jesus. <u>6</u>He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone. This is the message God gave to the world at just the right time. <u>7</u>And I have been chosen as a preacher and apostle to teach the Gentiles this message about faith and truth. I’m not exaggerating—just telling the truth...</h10></h3><p class=\"p1\"></p><h1>paul</h1><h3><h10>   <strong>1Co 5</strong><u>11</u>Because we understand our fearful responsibility to the Lord, we work hard to persuade others. God knows we are sincere, and I hope you know this, too. <u>12</u>Are we commending ourselves to you again? No, we are giving you a reason to be proud of us,* so you can answer those who brag about having a spectacular ministry rather than having a sincere heart. <u>13</u>If it seems we are crazy, it is to bring glory to God. And if we are in our right minds, it is for your benefit. <u>14</u>Either way, Christ’s love controls us.* Since we believe that Christ died for all, we also believe that we have all died to our old life.* <u>15</u>He died for everyone so that those who receive his new life will no longer live for themselves. Instead, they will live for Christ, who died and was raised for them.<br/>   <u>16</u>So we have stopped evaluating others from a human point of view. At one time we thought of Christ merely from a human point of view. How differently we know him now! <u>17</u>This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!<br/>   <u>18</u>And all of this is a gift from God, who brought us back to himself through Christ. And God has given us this task of reconciling people to him. <u>19</u>For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people’s sins against them. And he gave us this wonderful message of reconciliation. <u>20</u>So we are Christ’s ambassadors; God is making his appeal through us. We speak for Christ when we plead, “Come back to God!” <u>21</u>For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin,* so that we could be made right with God through Christ.</h10></h3><h5>*2Co 5:12 Some manuscripts read <i>proud of yourselves</i>.<br/>*2Co 5:14a Or <i>urges us on</i>.<br/>*2Co 5:14b Greek <i>Since one died for all, then all died</i>.<br/>*2Co 5:21 Or <i>to become sin itself</i>.</h5>","questionsTitle":"REFLECTION & APPLICATION","Questions":"<ul><li style=\"list-style-type: square; margin: 5px 0\">Is there someone in your personal world who is not walking in relationship with Jesus?
