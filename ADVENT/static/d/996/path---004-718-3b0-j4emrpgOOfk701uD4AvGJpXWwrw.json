","ref":"3.- ","html":"<h6>Isa 7:1-3,10-14</h6><p class=\"first-line-none chapter-1\"><strong>   7</strong><u>1</u>When Ahaz, son of Jotham and grandson of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Syria* and Pekah son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, set out to attack Jerusalem. However, they were unable to carry out their plan.</p><p><u>   2</u>The news had come to the royal court of Judah: </p><h1>A MESSENGER</h1><h4>Syria is allied with Israel* against us! </h4><p>So the hearts of the king and his people trembled with fear, like trees shaking in a storm.</p><p><u>   3</u>Then the Lord said to Isaiah, </p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Take your son Shear-jashub* and go out to meet King Ahaz. You will find him at the end of the aqueduct that feeds water into the upper pool, near the road leading to the field where cloth is washed.*</h2><p class=\"first-line-none\"><u>...</u></p><p class=\"first-line-none\"><u>   10</u>Later, the Lord sent this message to King Ahaz:</p><h1>god</h1><h2><u>11</u>Ask the Lord your God for a sign of confirmation, Ahaz. Make it as difficult as you want—as high as heaven or as deep as the place of the dead.*</h2><p><u>   12</u>But the king refused. </p><h1>AHAZ OF JUDAH</h1><h4>No, </h4><p>he said, </p><h1>AHAZ OF JUDAH</h1><h4>I will not test the Lord like that.</h4><p><u>   13</u>Then Isaiah said, </p><h1>ISAIAH</h1><h3>Listen well, you royal family of David! Isn’t it enough to exhaust human patience? Must you exhaust the patience of my God as well? <u>14</u>All right then, the Lord himself will give you the sign. Look! The virgin* will conceive a child! She will give birth to a son and will call him Immanuel (which means ‘God is with us’).</h3><h5><br/></h5><h6>Mat 1:18-25</h6><p><strong>   1</strong><u>18</u>This is how Jesus the Messiah was born. His mother, Mary, was engaged to be married to Joseph. But before the marriage took place, while she was still a virgin, she became pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit. <u>19</u>Joseph, to whom she was engaged, was a righteous man and did not want to disgrace her publicly, so he decided to break the engagement* quietly.</p><p><u>   20</u>As he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. </p><h1>AN ANGEL</h1><h4>Joseph, son of David,</h4><p> the angel said, </p><h1>AN ANGEL</h1><h4>do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. For the child within her was conceived by the Holy Spirit. <u>21</u>And she will have a son, and you are to name him Jesus,* for he will save his people from their sins.</h4><p><u>   22</u>All of this occurred to fulfill the Lord’s message through his prophet:</p><p class=\"line\"><u>    23</u>“Look! The virgin will conceive a child!<br/>   She will give birth to a son,<br/>   and they will call him Immanuel,*<br/>   which means ‘God is with us.’”</p><p class=\"top-1\"><u>   24</u>When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded and took Mary as his wife. <u>25</u>But he did not have sexual relations with her until her son was born. And Joseph named him Jesus.</p><h5>Isa 7:1 Hebrew <i>Aram</i>; also in 7:2, 4, 5, 8.<br/>Isa 7:2 Hebrew <i>Ephraim</i>, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel; also in 7:5, 8, 9, 17.<br/>Isa 7:3a <i>Shear-jashub</i> means “A remnant will return.”<br/>Isa 7:3b Or <i>bleached</i>.<br/>Isa 7:11 Hebrew <i>as deep as Sheol</i>.<br/>Isa 7:14 Or <i>young woman</i>.<br/>Mat 1:19 Greek <i>to divorce her</i>.<br/>Mat 1:21 <i>Jesus</i> means “The Lord saves.”<br/>Mat 1:23 Isa 7:14; 8:8, 10 (Greek version).</h5>","questionsTitle":"LEARNING FROM THE PAST","Question1":"With which character do you most identify in this story ?
