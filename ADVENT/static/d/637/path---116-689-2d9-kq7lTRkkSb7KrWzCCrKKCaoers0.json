All glory to him forever! Amen.</p><h6>Philippians 2:6-11</h6><p>Though he was God,<br />   he did not think of equality with God<br />   as something to cling to.<br />   Instead, he gave up his divine privileges;<br />   he took the humble position of a slave<br />   and was born as a human being.<br />   When he appeared in human form,<br />   he humbled himself in obedience to God<br />   and died a criminal’s death on a cross.<br>   Therefore, God elevated him to the place of highest honor<br />   and gave him the name above all other names,<br />   that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,<br />   in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br />   and every tongue declare that Jesus Christ is Lord,<br />   to the glory of God the Father.</p>       <h6>Colossians 1:15-20</h6><p>Christ is the visible image of the invisible God.<br />   He existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation,<br />   for through him God created everything<br />   in the heavenly realms and on earth.<br />   He made the things we can see<br />   and the things we can’t see—<br />   such as thrones, kingdoms, rulers, and authorities in the unseen world.<br />   Everything was created through him and for him.<br />   He existed before anything else,<br />   and he holds all creation together.<br />   Christ is also the head of the church,<br />   which is his body.<br />   He is the beginning,<br />   supreme over all who rise from the dead.<br />   So he is first in everything.<br />   For God in all his fullness<br />   was pleased to live in Christ,<br />   and through him God reconciled<br />   everything to himself.<br />   He made peace with everything in heaven and on earth<br />   by means of Christ’s blood on the cross.</p>       <h6>1 Timothy 1:17</h6><p>All honor and glory to God forever and ever!
