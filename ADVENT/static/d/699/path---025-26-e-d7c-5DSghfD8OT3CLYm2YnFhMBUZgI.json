As you read The Magnificat, the name traditionally given to Mary’s psalm of praise, ponder all the wondrous characteristics of our faithful God! As you prepare your heart for the Christmas celebration, you may want to read through the lyrics of Handel’s magnificent <a href=\"/ADVENT/108\" style=\"color: navy; text-decoration: underline\">Messiah</a>. Or, with lyrics in hand you may want to find a place to sit, turn on one of your digital devices and listen to it.<br/>   Whatever you chose to do, take time today to prepare your heart for the arrival celebration. You may have a lot to do today, but find a way to take time. Take the time to imagine. What must Mary have felt like as she anticipated the birth of her first child? Take time to anticipate. What goes through the heart of any young mother-to-be? What are the ponderings of her heart? Take time to ponder along with her. What great things will her child accomplish? What dreams fill the thoughts of the expectant mother? Take time to let expectancy arise in your heart too. The one who came is still coming. What might his advent mean for you? Let this day be pregnant with anticipation.</p>","ref":"DAY 24","html":"<p class=\"first-line-none\">   <strong>Luk 1</strong><u>26</u>In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a village in Galilee, <u>27</u>to a virgin named Mary.
