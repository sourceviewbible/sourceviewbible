Schaeffer: A Christian Worldview (5 Volume Set)</i></a>). He summarized the four basic presuppositions of a Biblical Christian Worldview thus:<br/><ul><li>1. God is infinite and personal.</li><li>2. Human beings are finite and personal.</li><li>3. Truth is constant and knowable.</li><li>4. Humans are responsible beings and our choices have consequences.</li></ul>   The Scriptures attest to these presuppositions. Jesus’ life embodies these truths. He not only bore witness to the truth. He is the truth.</p>","ref":"DAY 20","html":"<p class=\"first-line-none\">   <strong>Joh 8</strong><u>31</u>Jesus said to the people who believed in him, </p><h1>jesus</h1><h2>You are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teachings. <u>32</u>And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.</h2><h1>the crowd</h1><h4>   <u>33</u>But we are descendants of Abraham,</h4><p>they said. </p><h1>the crowd</h1><h4>We have never been slaves to anyone.
