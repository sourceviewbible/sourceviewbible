However, they were unable to carry out their plan.</p><p>   <u>2</u>The news had come to the royal court of Judah: </p><h1>A MESSENGER</h1><h4>Syria is allied with Israel* against us! </h4><p>So the hearts of the king and his people trembled with fear, like trees shaking in a storm.</p><p>   <u>3</u>Then the Lord said to Isaiah, </p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Take your son Shear-jashub* and go out to meet King Ahaz. You will find him at the end of the aqueduct that feeds water into the upper pool, near the road leading to the field where cloth is washed.* ...</h2><p class=\"first-line-none\">   <u>10</u>Later, the Lord sent this message to King Ahaz:</p><h1>god</h1><h2><u>11</u>Ask the Lord your God for a sign of confirmation, Ahaz.

She will give birth to a son and will call him Immanuel (which means ‘God is with us’)...</h3><p><strong>Mat 1</strong><u>18</u>This is how Jesus the Messiah was born. His mother, Mary, was engaged to be married to Joseph. But before the marriage took place, while she was still a virgin, she became pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit. <u>19</u>Joseph, to whom she was engaged, was a righteous man and did not want to disgrace her publicly, so he decided to break the engagement* quietly.</p><p>   <u>20</u>As he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. </p><h1>AN ANGEL</h1><h4>Joseph, son of David,</h4><p> the angel said, </p><h1>AN ANGEL</h1><h4>do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife.

Consider situations in your life in which you - like Ahaz - may have felt overwhelmed and fearful. Has there been a time in your life in which it looked like all hope was lost? How could God's Immanuel presence make a difference in such a time?</li><li style=\"list-style-type: square; margin: 5px 0\">An angel tells Joseph to name this miraculous child “Jesus” which means “the Lord saves” in Hebrew. He goes on to explain that Jesus comes to save us \"from\" our sins. The Greek preposition translated “from” is very visual. It's as if you walked out of a house and kept walking further and further away “from” the house. In the same way Jesus' salvation is intended to help distance us more and more from sin and its consequences. How can you let Jesus help you distance yourself more and more from sin during this Advent season?\"</li><li style=\"list-style-type: square; margin: 5px 0\">For further reflection, you may want to download a PDF of Brother Lawrence's famous book,  <a href=\"https://churchleaders.com/pastors/free-resources-pastors/145403-free-ebook-the-practice-of-the-presence-of-god.html\"target=\"_blank\"><i>Practicing the Presence of God</i></a></li></ul>","prevPath":"/003","nextPath":"/005"}},"pageContext":{}}
