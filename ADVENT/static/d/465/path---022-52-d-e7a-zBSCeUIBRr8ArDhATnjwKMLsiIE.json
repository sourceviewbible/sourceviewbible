ESV’s more traditional translation says, “the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.” The Greek word translated “dwelt” literally means “tabernacled.” Like the tabernacle of old which made space for the presence of God to dwell among his people when they crossed the desert to enter the promised land, Jesus – in his very being – pitched a tent and put God on display!<br/>   Looking at him we can see God as never before; never so clear; never so complete; never so engaging. This is the good news. He has come. He has dwelt in our world. Ours is the visited planet. And the God who came is still Immanuel in our midst.</p>","ref":"DAY 21","html":"<h1>john</h1><h3>   <strong>Joh 1</strong><u>1</u>In the beginning the Word already existed.<br/>   The Word was with God,<br/>   and the Word was God.<br/>   <u>2</u>He existed in the beginning with God.<br/>   <u>3</u>God created everything through him,<br/>   and nothing was created except through him.<br/>   <u>4</u>The Word gave life to everything that was created,*<br/>   and his life brought light to everyone.<br/>   <u>5</u>The light shines in the darkness,<br/>   and the darkness can never extinguish it.*<br/>   <u>6</u>God sent a man, John the Baptist,* <u>7</u>to tell about the light so that everyone might believe because of his testimony. <u>8</u>John himself was not the light; he was simply a witness to tell about the light. <u>9</u>The one who is the true light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.<br/>   <u>10</u>He came into the very world he created, but the world didn’t recognize him. <u>11</u>He came to his own people, and even they rejected him. <u>12</u>But to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God. <u>13</u>They are reborn—not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God.<br/>   <u>14</u>So the Word became human* and made his home among us.

One person who lived intentionally aware of Jesus’ incarnational presence was Patrick of Ireland. Take time to consider his famous prayer, known as <a href=\"/ADVENT/111\" style=\"color:grey; text-decoration: underline\">Saint Patrick’s Shield</a>. How does it tie in with the Scripture passages about Jesus’ incarnation? Reflect on this and then pray it out to the Lord.</li></ul>","prevPath":"/021","nextPath":"/023"}},"pageContext":{}}
