Ask God to help them; intercede on their behalf, and give thanks for them. <u>2</u>Pray this way for kings and all who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives marked by godliness and dignity. <u>3</u>This is good and pleases God our Savior, <u>4</u>who wants everyone to be saved and to understand the truth. <u>5</u>For,<br/>   There is one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity—the man Christ Jesus. <u>6</u>He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone. This is the message God gave to the world at just the right time. <u>7</u>And I have been chosen as a preacher and apostle to teach the Gentiles this message about faith and truth. I’m not exaggerating—just telling the truth.</h10></h3><p class=\"p1\"></p><br/><h1>paul</h1><h3><h10>   <strong>1Co 5</strong><u>11</u>Because we understand our fearful responsibility to the Lord, we work hard to persuade others. God knows we are sincere, and I hope you know this, too. <u>12</u>Are we commending ourselves to you again? No, we are giving you a reason to be proud of us,* so you can answer those who brag about having a spectacular ministry rather than having a sincere heart. <u>13</u>If it seems we are crazy, it is to bring glory to God. And if we are in our right minds, it is for your benefit. <u>14</u>Either way, Christ’s love controls us.* Since we believe that Christ died for all, we also believe that we have all died to our old life.* <u>15</u>He died for everyone so that those who receive his new life will no longer live for themselves. Instead, they will live for Christ, who died and was raised for them.<br/>   <u>16</u>So we have stopped evaluating others from a human point of view. At one time we thought of Christ merely from a human point of view. How differently we know him now! <u>17</u>This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!<br/>   <u>18</u>And all of this is a gift from God, who brought us back to himself through Christ. And God has given us this task of reconciling people to him. <u>19</u>For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people’s sins against them. And he gave us this wonderful message of reconciliation. <u>20</u>So we are Christ’s ambassadors; God is making his appeal through us. We speak for Christ when we plead, “Come back to God!” <u>21</u>For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin,* so that we could be made right with God through Christ.</h10></h3><h5>*2Co 5:12 Some manuscripts read <i>proud of yourselves</i>.<br/>*2Co 5:14a Or <i>urges us on</i>.<br/>*2Co 5:14b Greek <i>Since one died for all, then all died</i>.<br/>*2Co 5:21 Or <i>to become sin itself</i>.</h5>","questionsTitle":"LEARNING FROM THE PAST","Questions":"<ul><li>  With which character do you most identify in this story ?
