This was the greatest story of salvation for the people of Israel. Jesus' advent is the greatest story of salvation for all people; thus the parallel. And the mystery thickens. From where would the messiah in fact come? From Bethlehem? From Egypt? From where?","ref":"DAY 5","html":"</p><h1>God</h1><h2>      <strong>Hos 11</strong><u>1</u>When Israel was a child, I loved him,<br/>   and I called my son out of Egypt.<br/>   <u>2</u>But the more I called to him,<br/>   the farther he moved from me,*<br/>   offering sacrifices to the images of Baal<br/>   and burning incense to idols.<br/>   <u>3</u>I myself taught Israel<u>*</u> how to walk,<br/>   leading him along by the hand.<br/>   But he doesn’t know or even care<br/>   that it was I who took care of him.<br/>   <u>4</u>I led Israel along<br/>   with my ropes of kindness and love.<br/>   I lifted the yoke from his neck,<br/>   and I myself stooped to feed him. <br/>   ...  <br/>   <u>7</u>They call me the Most High,<br/>   but they don’t truly honor me.<br/>      <u>8</u>Oh, how can I give you up, Israel?<br/>   How can I let you go?<br/>   How can I destroy you like Admah<br/>   or demolish you like Zeboiim?<br/>   My heart is torn within me,<br/>    and my compassion overflows.<br/>   <u>9</u>No, I will not unleash my fierce anger.<br/>   I will not completely destroy Israel,<br/>   for I am God and not a mere mortal.<br/>   I am the Holy One living among you,<br/>   and I will not come to destroy.</h2><br /><p class=\"first-line-none\"><br />   <strong>Mat 2</strong><u>13</u>After the wise men were gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. </p><h1>an angel</h1><h4>Get up!

Note and reflect on all the verbs which describe God's actions. How would you describe such a God? What would be an appropriate response to these divine actions?","Question2":"Consider all that God did in the Mat 2 passage to “save his son” from what seemed like a certain premature death at the hand of threatened political leaders.
