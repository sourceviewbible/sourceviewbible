That is what the psalmist meant when he wrote:<br/>   “For this, I will praise you among the Gentiles;<br/>   I will sing praises to your name.”*<br/>   <u>10</u>And in another place it is written,<br/>   “Rejoice with his people,<br/>   you Gentiles.”*<i><br/></i><u>11</u>And yet again,<br/>   “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles.<br/>   Praise him, all you people of the earth.”*<i><br/></i><u>12</u>And in another place Isaiah said,<br/>   “The heir to David’s throne* will come,<br/>   and he will rule over the Gentiles.<br/>   They will place their hope on him.”*<i><br/>   </i><u>13</u>I pray that God, the source of hope, will fill you completely with joy and peace because you trust in him. Then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the Holy Spirit.</h3><h5>Isa 42:4 Greek version reads <i>And his name will be the hope of all the world</i>. Compare Matt 12:21.<br/>Rom 15:8 Greek <i>servant of circumcision</i>.<br/>Rom 15:9 Ps 18:49.<br/>Rom 15:10 Deut 32:43.<br/>Rom 15:11 Ps 117:1.<br/>Rom 15:12a Greek <i>The root of Jesse</i>. David was the son of Jesse.<br/>Rom 15:12b Isa 11:10 (Greek version).</h5>","questionsTitle":"LEARNING FROM THE PAST","Question1":"With which character do you most identify in this story ?
