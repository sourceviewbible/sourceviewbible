Reading 2 Corinthians is something like that. We may not know all the details, but the feelings come through loud and clear as Paul lays out his joys, sorrows, ambitions, and frustrations for the believers at Corinth.

In the midst of it all, a powerful lesson shines through: In your weakness, you discover God’s power!</p><p>Be especially alert for practical examples and advice on resolving conflict: personality conflicts between church members, theological conflicts over false teachings, and cultural conflicts between the church and the world.</p><h6>Who wrote this book and why?</h6><p>The apostle Paul wrote it approximately AD 55.

Paul wrote to calm the disagreements, to restore unity to the body of believers, and to reestablish his role as leader.</p><h6>How does it fit in the big story?</h6><p>Even this early on, churches like Corinth had problems running smoothly. Paul’s instructions on handling dissension within the church, false teaching, and church leadership were given to help resolve these recurring problems. He also draws believers’ attention outward by seeking their help for the poorer believers in Jerusalem.</p><h6>SourceView Insights</h6><p>All the SourceView text is black because this letter contains only one side of Paul’s dialogue with the church at Corinth.
