We can be swamped with a barrage of information. How do we sort it all out? How do we tell which information is important—or true? The danger of receiving false information existed in the church in Peter’s day—as in ours. That’s why the message of 2 Peter is so critical today.</p><p>Peter confronts those spreading doubts about Jesus’ deity with great personal authority, for he himself was an eyewitness to “his majesty” (2Pe 1:16).

He also counsels us to pursue a godly lifestyle anticipating Jesus’ return. Peter tells us that we can hurry along the day of Jesus’ coming (2Pe 3:12) by actively sharing our faith with others.

This is God’s deepest desire, his most heartfelt longing. We can bring great joy to his heart as we lead others into living relationship with him.</p><h6>Who wrote this letter and when?</h6><p>The apostle Peter wrote it most likely from Rome, sometime between AD 64 and 68.</p><h6>To whom was this letter written and why?</h6><p>To the same people who received his first letter: believers scattered throughout the regions of Asia Minor, in what is present-day Turkey. Peter wrote to warn them about false teachers and strengthen them with the truth.</p><h6>What was the historical context?</h6><p>Emperor Nero was on the throne in Rome at the time Peter wrote this letter. Nero was a man without moral principles. His volatile nature created a cruel and unstable political climate which threatened both the empire and the young church. At the same time, Christians in Asia Minor were in danger of being led astray by eloquent but erring teachers who had infiltrated their fellowship.</p><h6>SourceView Insights</h6><p>All the SourceView text is black since Peter’s letter encouraging believers to stand firm in their faith reflects just one side of a two-sided conversation.
