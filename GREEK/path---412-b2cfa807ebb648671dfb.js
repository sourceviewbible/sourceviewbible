So don’t give up!</p><h6>How to read 1 Peter</h6><p>Where do you find your hope in times of crises? Where can you find the strength to carry on in hard times? What will help you grow in faith when difficulties abound? The answer? Jesus! Because of what he has done you have been given a new identity. You now belong to God, and form part of a “chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession” (1Pe 2:9).</p><p>So what about those tough times? God can and will use difficulties to strengthen us. Discover how faith, refined by suffering, can help you see the Lord more clearly and get to know him more dearly. The words of this letter encourage us to hold firm in difficult times.</p><p>But Peter did not stop there. It’s not just a matter of survival. As we learn to embrace our royal identity, we can see the kingdom of God grow—even in the face of adversity. Peter urges us to adopt an on-the-offensive attitude in the midst of difficulty, and “proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light” (1Pe 2:9).</p><h6>Who wrote this book and why?</h6><p>Sometime in the early to mid AD 60s, Peter—one of the original twelve apostles—wrote it from Rome to believers scattered throughout the regions of Asia Minor, in what is now Turkey. Peter saw that increasing hardship and persecution had caused some Christians to wonder if God had abandoned them. He wrote to encourage them by offering hope and meaning in the midst of their suffering.</p><h6>Where does it fit into God’s big story?</h6><p>At first the Roman government had given Christians the same freedom of religion as the Jews. As the rift between Jews and Christians grew, tolerance for Christianity faded. Because Roman policy was to ban problem religions perceived as a threat to the empire’s stability, Christians began facing discrimination, violence, arrest, and confiscation of property. Some were beginning to waver in their faith. Because Peter had himself been imprisoned and beaten for his faith, he could address the subject of suffering with genuine authority.</p><h6>SourceView Insights</h6><p>Peter’s letter to encourage suffering believers is one side of an on-going conversation; thus all SourceView text is black.
