Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. <u>3</u>You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. <u>4</u>Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch can’t bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me. <u>5</u>I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. <u>6</u>If a man doesn’t remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned. <u>7</u>If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you. <br />   <u>8</u>In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples. <u>9</u>Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love. <u>10</u>If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and remain in his love. <u>11</u>I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full. <br />   <u>12</u>This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you. <u>13</u>Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. <u>14</u>You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you. <u>15</u>No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesn’t know what his lord does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you. <u>16</u>You didn’t choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you. <br />   <u>17</u>I command these things to you, that you may love one another. <u>18</u>If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you. <u>19</u>If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. <u>20</u>Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his lord.’* If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also. <u>21</u>But all these things will they do to you for my name’s sake, because they don’t know him who sent me. <u>22</u>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. <u>23</u>He who hates me, hates my Father also. <u>24</u>If I hadn’t done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldn’t have had sin. But now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father. <u>25</u>But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, ‘They hated me without a cause.’* <br />   <u>26</u>When the Counselor* has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me. <u>27</u>You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning. <br />   <strong>16</strong><u>1</u>These things have I spoken to you, so that you wouldn’t be caused to stumble. <u>2</u>They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God. <u>3</u>They will do these things* because they have not known the Father, nor me. <u>4</u>But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I didn’t tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you. <u>5</u>But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ <u>6</u>But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart. <u>7</u>Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don’t go away, the Counselor won’t come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. <u>8</u>When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment; <u>9</u>about sin, because they don’t believe in me; <u>10</u>about righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you won’t see me any more; <u>11</u>about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged. <br />   <u>12</u>I have yet many things to tell you, but you can’t bear them now. <u>13</u>However when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you things that are coming. <u>14</u>He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you. <u>15</u>All things whatever the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takes* of mine, and will declare it to you. <u>16</u>A little while, and you will not see me. Again a little while, and you will see me.</h2><p>   <u>17</u>Some of his disciples therefore said to one another,</p><h1>ELEVEN DISCIPLES</h1><h3>What is this that he says to us, ‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;’and, ‘Because I go to the Father’?</h3><p><u>18</u>They said therefore,</p><h1>ELEVEN DISCIPLES</h1><h3>What is this that he says, ‘A little while’? We don’t know what he is saying.</h3><p>   <u>19</u>Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, ‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?’ <u>20</u>Most certainly I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. <u>21</u>A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she doesn’t remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world. <u>22</u>Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you. <br />   <u>23</u>In that day you will ask me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. <u>24</u>Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full. <u>25</u>I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father. <u>26</u>In that day you will ask in my name; and I don’t say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you, <u>27</u>for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from God. <u>28</u>I came from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</h2><p>   <u>29</u>His disciples said to him,</p><h1>ELEVEN DISCIPLES</h1><h3>Behold, now you speak plainly, and speak no figures of speech. <u>30</u>Now we know that you know all things, and don’t need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came from God.</h3><p>   <u>31</u>Jesus answered them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Do you now believe? <u>32</u>Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. <u>33</u>I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world.</h2><p>   <strong>17</strong><u>1</u>Jesus said these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may also glorify you; <u>2</u>even as you gave him authority over all flesh, he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him. <u>3</u>This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ. <u>4</u>I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do. <u>5</u>Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed. <u>6</u>I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word. <u>7</u>Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you, <u>8</u>for the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that I came from you, and they have believed that you sent me. <u>9</u>I pray for them. I don’t pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours. <u>10</u>All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them. <u>11</u>I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are. <u>12</u>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. Those whom you have given me I have kept. None of them is lost, except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. <u>13</u>But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves. <u>14</u>I have given them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. <u>15</u>I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one. <u>16</u>They are not of the world even as I am not of the world. <u>17</u>Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.* <u>18</u>As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world. <u>19</u>For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth. <u>20</u>Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who believe in me through their word, <u>21</u>that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that you sent me. <u>22</u>The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one; <u>23</u>I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me, and loved them, even as you loved me. <u>24</u>Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world. <u>25</u>Righteous Father, the world hasn’t known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me. <u>26</u>I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them.</h2><h5>*John 15:20 John 13:16 <br />*John 15:25 Psalms 35:19; 69:4 <br />*John 15:26 Greek Parakletos: Counselor, Helper, Advocate, Intercessor, and Comforter. <br />*John 16:3 TR adds “to you” <br />*John 16:15 TR reads “will take” instead of “takes” <br />*John 17:17 Psalm 119:142</h5>",path:"/348",Question1:"Consider the acts of God described in this passage.",Question2:"What do these illustrate about the ways of God?",Question3:"Have you experienced these ways of God in your life?
