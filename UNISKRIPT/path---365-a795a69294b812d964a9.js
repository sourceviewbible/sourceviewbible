As it is written, “But the righteous shall live by faith.”* <u>18</u>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, <u>19</u>because that which is known of God is revealed in them, for God revealed it to them. <u>20</u>For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse. <u>21</u>Because, knowing God, they didn’t glorify him as God, neither gave thanks, but became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless heart was darkened.<br />   <u>22</u>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, <u>23</u>and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things. <u>24</u>Therefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves, <u>25</u>who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.<br />   <u>26</u>For this reason, God gave them up to vile passions. For their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature. <u>27</u>Likewise also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error. <u>28</u>Even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting; <u>29</u>being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil habits, secret slanderers, <u>30</u>backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, <u>31</u>without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful; <u>32</u>who, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also approve of those who practice them.<br />   <strong>2</strong><u>1</u>Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things. <u>2</u>We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things. <u>3</u>Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God? <u>4</u>Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? <u>5</u>But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God; <u>6</u>who “will pay back to everyone according to their works:”* <u>7</u>to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life; <u>8</u>but to those who are self-seeking, and don’t obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation, <u>9</u>oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who does evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.<br />   <u>10</u>But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who does good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. <u>11</u>For there is no partiality with God. <u>12</u>For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. <u>13</u>For it isn’t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified <u>14</u>(for when Gentiles who don’t have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves, <u>15</u>in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them) <u>16</u>in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ.<br />   <u>17</u>Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God, <u>18</u>and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law, <u>19</u>and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, <u>20</u>a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth. <u>21</u>You therefore who teach another, don’t you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn’t steal, do you steal? <u>22</u>You who say a man shouldn’t commit adultery. Do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? <u>23</u>You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God? <u>24</u>For “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,”* just as it is written. <u>25</u>For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. <u>26</u>If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won’t his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision? <u>27</u>Won’t the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law? <u>28</u>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; <u>29</u>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.<br />   <strong>3</strong><u>1</u>Then what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the profit of circumcision? <u>2</u>Much in every way! Because first of all, they were entrusted with the revelations of God. <u>3</u>For what if some were without faith? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God? <u>4</u>May it never be! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written,<br />   That you might be justified in your words,<br />   and might prevail when you come into judgment.”*<br />   <u>5</u>But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak like men do. <u>6</u>May it never be! For then how will God judge the world? <u>7</u>For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner? <u>8</u>Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), “Let us do evil, that good may come?” Those who say so are justly condemned. <u>9</u>What then? Are we better than they? No, in no way. For we previously warned both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin. <u>10</u>As it is written,<br />   There is no one righteous;<br />   no, not one.<br />   <u>11</u>There is no one who understands.<br />   There is no one who seeks after God.<br />   <u>12</u>They have all turned aside.<br />   They have together become unprofitable.<br />   There is no one who does good,<br />   no, not so much as one.”*<br />   <u>13</u>Their throat is an open tomb.<br />   With their tongues they have used deceit.”*<br />   The poison of vipers is under their lips”;*<br />   <u>14</u>“whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.”*<br />   <u>15</u>Their feet are swift to shed blood.<br />   <u>16</u>Destruction and misery are in their ways.<br />   <u>17</u>The way of peace, they haven’t known.”*<br />   <u>18</u>There is no fear of God before their eyes.”*<br />   <u>19</u>Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be closed, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God. <u>20</u>Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight. For through the law comes the knowledge of sin.</p><h5>*Romans 1:3 or, seed<br />*Romans 1:17 Habakkuk 2:4<br />*Romans 2:6 Psalm 62:12; Proverbs 24:12<br />*Romans 2:24 Isaiah 52:5; Ezekiel 36:22<br />*Romans 3:4 Psalm 51:4<br />*Romans 3:12 Psalms 14:1-3; 53:1-3; Ecclesiastes 7:20<br />*Romans 3:13 Psalm 5:9<br />*Romans 3:13 Psalm 140:3<br />*Romans 3:14 Psalm 10:7<br />*Romans 3:17 Isaiah 59:7-8<br />*Romans 3:18 Psalm 36:1</h5>",path:"/365",Question1:"To compare is to associate two or more similar persons, ideas, or situations.
