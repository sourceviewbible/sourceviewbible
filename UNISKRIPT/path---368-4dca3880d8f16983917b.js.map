I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit, <u>2</u>that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart. <u>3</u>For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers’ sake, my relatives according to the flesh, <u>4</u>who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises; <u>5</u>of whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever. Amen.<br />   <u>6</u>But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel. <u>7</u>Neither, because they are Abraham’s offspring,* are they all children. But, “your offspring* will be accounted as from Isaac.”* <u>8</u>That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as heirs. <u>9</u>For this is a word of promise, “At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.”* <u>10</u>Not only so, but Rebekah also conceived by one, by our father Isaac. <u>11</u>For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,* <u>12</u>it was said to her, “The elder will serve the younger.”* <u>13</u>Even as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”*<br />   <u>14</u>What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be! <u>15</u>For he said to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”* <u>16</u>So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy. <u>17</u>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”* <u>18</u>So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires. <u>19</u>You will say then to me, “Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?” <u>20</u>But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, “Why did you make me like this?”* <u>21</u>Or hasn’t the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor? <u>22</u>What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction, <u>23</u>and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory, <u>24</u>us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles? <u>25</u>As he says also in Hosea,<br />   I will call them ‘my people,’ which were not my people;<br />   and her ‘beloved,’ who was not beloved.”*<br />   <u>26</u>It will be that in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’<br />   There they will be called ‘children of the living God.’”*<br />   <u>27</u>Isaiah cries concerning Israel,<br />   If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea,<br />   it is the remnant who will be saved;<br />   <u>28</u>for He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness,<br />   because the LORD will make a short work upon the earth.”*<br />   <u>29</u>As Isaiah has said before,<br />   Unless the Lord of Armies* had left us a seed,<br />   we would have become like Sodom,<br />   and would have been made like Gomorrah.”*<br />   <u>30</u>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who didn’t follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith; <u>31</u>but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn’t arrive at the law of righteousness. <u>32</u>Why? Because they didn’t seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the stumbling stone; <u>33</u>even as it is written,<br />   Behold,* I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense;<br />   and no one who believes in him will be disappointed.”*<br />   <strong>10</strong><u>1</u>Brothers, my heart’s desire and my prayer to God is for Israel, that they may be saved. <u>2</u>For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. <u>3</u>For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didn’t subject themselves to the righteousness of God. <u>4</u>For Christ is the fulfillment* of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. <u>5</u>For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, “The one who does them will live by them.”* <u>6</u>But the righteousness which is of faith says this, “Don’t say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’* (that is, to bring Christ down); <u>7</u>or, ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’* (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)” <u>8</u>But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart”;* that is, the word of faith, which we preach: <u>9</u>that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. <u>10</u>For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. <u>11</u>For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.”*<br />   <u>12</u>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him. <u>13</u>For, “Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.”* <u>14</u>How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher? <u>15</u>And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written:<br />   How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace,<br />   who bring glad tidings of good things!”*<br />   <u>16</u>But they didn’t all listen to the glad news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?”* <u>17</u>So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. <u>18</u>But I say, didn’t they hear? Yes, most certainly,<br />   Their sound went out into all the earth,<br />   their words to the ends of the world.”*<br />   <u>19</u>But I ask, didn’t Israel know? First Moses says,<br />   I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation,<br />   with a nation void of understanding I will make you angry.”*<br />   <u>20</u>Isaiah is very bold, and says,<br />   I was found by those who didn’t seek me.<br />   I was revealed to those who didn’t ask for me.”*<br />   <u>21</u>But as to Israel he says, “All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”*<br />   <strong>11</strong><u>1</u>I ask then, did God reject his people? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. <u>2</u>God didn’t reject his people, which he foreknew. Or don’t you know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel: <u>3</u>“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.”* <u>4</u>But how does God answer him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”* <u>5</u>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. <u>6</u>And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.<br />   <u>7</u>What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn’t obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened. <u>8</u>According as it is written, “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.”* <u>9</u>David says,<br />   Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,<br />   a stumbling block, and a retribution to them.<br />   <u>10</u>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see.<br />   Bow down their back always.”*<br />   <u>11</u>I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy. <u>12</u>Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness? <u>13</u>For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry; <u>14</u>if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them. <u>15</u>For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead? <u>16</u>If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches. <u>17</u>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree; <u>18</u>don’t boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you. <u>19</u>You will say then, “Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.” <u>20</u>True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don’t be conceited, but fear; <u>21</u>for if God didn’t spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. <u>22</u>See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off. <u>23</u>They also, if they don’t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. <u>24</u>For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree? <u>25</u>For I don’t desire you to be ignorant, brothers,* of this mystery, so that you won’t be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, <u>26</u>and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written,<br />   There will come out of Zion the Deliverer,<br />   and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.<br />   <u>27</u>This is my covenant to them,<br />   when I will take away their sins.”*<br />   <u>28</u>Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake. <u>29</u>For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. <u>30</u>For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience, <u>31</u>even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy. <u>32</u>For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.<br />   <u>33</u>Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!<br />   <u>34</u>For who has known the mind of the Lord?<br />   Or who has been his counselor?”*<br />   <u>35</u>Or who has first given to him,<br />   and it will be repaid to him again?”*<br />   <u>36</u>For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever!
