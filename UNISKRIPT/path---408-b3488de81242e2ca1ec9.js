For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God. <u>6</u>Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him. <u>7</u>By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear,* prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith. <u>8</u>By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he went. <u>9</u>By faith, he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise. <u>10</u>For he looked for the city which has the foundations, whose builder and maker is God. <u>11</u>By faith, even Sarah herself received power to conceive, and she bore a child when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised. <u>12</u>Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead. <u>13</u>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen* them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. <u>14</u>For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. <u>15</u>If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had enough time to return. <u>16</u>But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.<br />   <u>17</u>By faith, Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son; <u>18</u>even he to whom it was said, “your offspring* will be accounted as from Isaac”;* <u>19</u>concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead. <u>20</u>By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come. <u>21</u>By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff. <u>22</u>By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave instructions concerning his bones. <u>23</u>By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment. <u>24</u>By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, <u>25</u>choosing rather to share ill treatment with God’s people, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time; <u>26</u>accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward. <u>27</u>By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. <u>28</u>By faith, he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them. <u>29</u>By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up. <u>30</u>By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encircled for seven days. <u>31</u>By faith, Rahab the prostitute, didn’t perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies in peace. <u>32</u>What more shall I say? For the time would fail me if I told of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets; <u>33</u>who, through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,* <u>34</u>quenched the power of fire,* escaped the edge of the sword,* from weakness were made strong, grew mighty in war, and caused foreign armies to flee. <u>35</u>Women received their dead by resurrection.* Others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. <u>36</u>Others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, moreover by bonds and imprisonment. <u>37</u>They were stoned.* They were sawn apart. They were tempted. They were slain with the sword.* They went around in sheep skins and in goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated <u>38</u>(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts, mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth. <u>39</u>These all, having had testimony given to them through their faith, didn’t receive the promise, <u>40</u>God having provided some better thing concerning us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.<br />   <strong>12</strong><u>1</u>Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, <u>2</u>looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. <u>3</u>For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, that you don’t grow weary, fainting in your souls. <u>4</u>You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin; <u>5</u>and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children,<br />   My son, don’t take lightly the chastening of the Lord,<br />   nor faint when you are reproved by him;<br />   <u>6</u>For whom the Lord loves, he chastens,<br />   and scourges every son whom he receives.”*<br />   <u>7</u>It is for discipline that you endure. God deals with you as with children, for what son is there whom his father doesn’t discipline? <u>8</u>But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then are you illegitimate, and not children. <u>9</u>Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live? <u>10</u>For they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness. <u>11</u>All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby. <u>12</u>Therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,* <u>13</u>and make straight paths for your feet,* so that which is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.</p><h5>*Hebrews 10:30 Deuteronomy 32:35<br />*Hebrews 10:30 Deuteronomy 32:36; Psalm 135:14<br />*Hebrews 10:38 Habakkuk 2:3-4<br />*Hebrews 11:7 or, reverence<br />*Hebrews 11:13 TR adds “and being convinced of”<br />*Hebrews 11:18 or, seed<br />*Hebrews 11:18 Genesis 21:12<br />*Hebrews 11:33 Daniel 6:22-23<br />*Hebrews 11:34 Daniel 3:1-30<br />*Hebrews 11:34 1 Kings 19:1-3; 2 Kings 6:31-7:20<br />*Hebrews 11:35 1 Kings 17:17-23; 2 Kings 4:32-37<br />*Hebrews 11:37 2 Chronicles 24:20-21<br />*Hebrews 11:37 Jeremiah 26:20-23; 1 Kings 19:10<br />*Hebrews 12:6 Proverbs 3:11-12<br />*Hebrews 12:12 Isaiah 35:3<br />*Hebrews 12:13 Proverbs 4:26</h5>",path:"/408",Question1:"With which character do you most identify in this passage?
