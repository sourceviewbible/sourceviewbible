Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good. <u>10</u>In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate to one another; in honor preferring one another; <u>11</u>not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; <u>12</u>rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer; <u>13</u>contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality. <u>14</u>Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don’t curse. <u>15</u>Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep. <u>16</u>Be of the same mind one toward another. Don’t set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don’t be wise in your own conceits. <u>17</u>Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men. <u>18</u>If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men. <u>19</u>Don’t seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God’s wrath. For it is written, “Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.”* <u>20</u>Therefore<br />   If your enemy is hungry, feed him.<br />   If he is thirsty, give him a drink;<br />   for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head.”*<br />   <u>21</u>Don’t be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.<br />   <strong>13</strong><u>1</u>Let every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those who exist are ordained by God. <u>2</u>Therefore he who resists the authority, withstands the ordinance of God; and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgment. <u>3</u>For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Do you desire to have no fear of the authority? Do that which is good, and you will have praise from the same, <u>4</u>for he is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid, for he doesn’t bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who does evil. <u>5</u>Therefore you need to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience’ sake. <u>6</u>For this reason you also pay taxes, for they are servants of God’s service, attending continually on this very thing. <u>7</u>Therefore give everyone what you owe: if you owe taxes, pay taxes; if customs, then customs; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor. <u>8</u>Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.<br />   <u>9</u>For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,”* “You shall not covet,”* and whatever other commandments there are, are all summed up in this saying, namely, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”* <u>10</u>Love doesn’t harm a neighbor. Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law. <u>11</u>Do this, knowing the time, that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep, for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed. <u>12</u>The night is far gone, and the day is near. Let’s therefore throw off the deeds of darkness, and let’s put on the armor of light. <u>13</u>Let us walk properly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts, and not in strife and jealousy. <u>14</u>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts.<br />   <strong>14</strong><u>1</u>Now accept one who is weak in faith, but not for disputes over opinions. <u>2</u>One man has faith to eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables. <u>3</u>Don’t let him who eats despise him who doesn’t eat. Don’t let him who doesn’t eat judge him who eats, for God has accepted him. <u>4</u>Who are you who judge another’s servant? To his own lord he stands or falls. Yes, he will be made to stand, for God has power to make him stand.<br />   <u>5</u>One man esteems one day as more important. Another esteems every day alike. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind. <u>6</u>He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks. He who doesn’t eat, to the Lord he doesn’t eat, and gives God thanks. <u>7</u>For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself. <u>8</u>For if we live, we live to the Lord. Or if we die, we die to the Lord. If therefore we live or die, we are the Lord’s. <u>9</u>For to this end Christ died, rose, and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.<br />   <u>10</u>But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. <u>11</u>For it is written,<br />   ‘As I live,’ says the Lord, ‘to me every knee will bow.<br />   Every tongue will confess to God.’”*<br />   <u>12</u>So then each one of us will give account of himself to God. <u>13</u>Therefore let’s not judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his brother’s way, or an occasion for falling. <u>14</u>I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except that to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. <u>15</u>Yet if because of food your brother is grieved, you walk no longer in love. Don’t destroy with your food him for whom Christ died. <u>16</u>Then don’t let your good be slandered, <u>17</u>for God’s Kingdom is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. <u>18</u>For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men. <u>19</u>So then, let us follow after things which make for peace, and things by which we may build one another up. <u>20</u>Don’t overthrow God’s work for food’s sake. All things indeed are clean, however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating. <u>21</u>It is good to not eat meat, drink wine, nor do anything by which your brother stumbles, is offended, or is made weak.<br />   <u>22</u>Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who doesn’t judge himself in that which he approves. <u>23</u>But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it isn’t of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin.<br />   <u>24</u>Now to him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret through long ages, <u>25</u>but now is revealed, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known for obedience of faith to all the nations; <u>26</u>to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen.*<br />   <strong>15</strong><u>1</u>Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves. <u>2</u>Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, to be building him up. <u>3</u>For even Christ didn’t please himself. But, as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.”* <u>4</u>For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that through patience and through encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope. <u>5</u>Now the God of patience and of encouragement grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus, <u>6</u>that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br />   <u>7</u>Therefore accept one another, even as Christ also accepted you,* to the glory of God. <u>8</u>Now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers, <u>9</u>and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy.
