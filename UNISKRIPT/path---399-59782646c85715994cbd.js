How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day <u>4</u>longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy; <u>5</u>having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.<br />   <u>6</u>For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. <u>7</u>For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control. <u>8</u>Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God, <u>9</u>who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, <u>10</u>but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News. <u>11</u>For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. <u>12</u>For this cause I also suffer these things.<br />   Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.<br />   <u>13</u>Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. <u>14</u>That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.<br />   <u>15</u>This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. <u>16</u>May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain, <u>17</u>but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me <u>18</u>(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.<br />   <strong>2</strong><u>1</u>You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. <u>2</u>The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also. <u>3</u>You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. <u>4</u>No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier. <u>5</u>Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules. <u>6</u>The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops. <u>7</u>Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.<br />   <u>8</u>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring* of David, according to my Good News, <u>9</u>in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained. <u>10</u>Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. <u>11</u>This saying is trustworthy:<br />   For if we died with him,<br />   we will also live with him.<br />   <u>12</u>If we endure,<br />   we will also reign with him.<br />   If we deny him,<br />   he also will deny us.<br />   <u>13</u>If we are faithless,<br />   he remains faithful.<br />   He can’t deny himself.”<br />   <u>14</u>Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don’t argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.<br />   <u>15</u>Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth. <u>16</u>But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness, <u>17</u>and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; <u>18</u>men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some. <u>19</u>However God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal, “The Lord knows those who are his,”* and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord* depart from unrighteousness.” <u>20</u>Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor. <u>21</u>If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work.<br />   <u>22</u>Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. <u>23</u>But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife. <u>24</u>The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient, <u>25</u>in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth, <u>26</u>and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.<br />   <strong>3</strong><u>1</u>But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come. <u>2</u>For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, <u>3</u>without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good, <u>4</u>traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; <u>5</u>holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also. <u>6</u>For some of these are people who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, <u>7</u>always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. <u>8</u>Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith, are rejected. <u>9</u>But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be. <u>10</u>But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, <u>11</u>persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all. <u>12</u>Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. <u>13</u>But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. <u>14</u>But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them. <u>15</u>From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus. <u>16</u>Every Scripture is God-breathed and* profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, <u>17</u>that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.<br />   <strong>4</strong><u>1</u>I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom: <u>2</u>preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching. <u>3</u>For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts; <u>4</u>and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables. <u>5</u>But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.<br />   <u>6</u>For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come. <u>7</u>I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith. <u>8</u>From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing. <u>9</u>Be diligent to come to me soon, <u>10</u>for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. <u>11</u>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. <u>12</u>But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. <u>13</u>Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments. <u>14</u>Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds, <u>15</u>of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.<br />   <u>16</u>At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them. <u>17</u>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. <u>18</u>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.<br />   <u>19</u>Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. <u>20</u>Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick. <u>21</u>Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers. <u>22</u>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</p><h5>*2 Timothy 2:8 or, seed<br />*2 Timothy 2:19 Numbers 16:5<br />*2 Timothy 2:19 TR reads “Christ” instead of “the Lord”<br />*2 Timothy 3:16 or, Every writing inspired by God is</h5>",path:"/399",Question1:"What do you like about this portion of Scripture?",Question2:"What do you observe about the ways of God?",Question3:"What do you observe about the key characters in this portion of Scripture?",Question4:"What response are you wanting to make in light of these observations?",prevPath:"/398",nextPath:"/400"}},pathContext:{}}}});
