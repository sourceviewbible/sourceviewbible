They came out, crying with a loud voice. Many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed. <u>8</u>There was great joy in that city.<br />   <u>9</u>But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who used to practice sorcery in the city, and amazed the people of Samaria, making himself out to be some great one, <u>10</u>to whom they all listened, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is that great power of God.” <u>11</u>They listened to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries. <u>12</u>But when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning God’s Kingdom and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. <u>13</u>Simon himself also believed. Being baptized, he continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles occurring, he was amazed.<br />   <u>14</u>Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, <u>15</u>who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit; <u>16</u>for as yet he had fallen on none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus. <u>17</u>Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. <u>18</u>Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money, <u>19</u>saying,</p><h1>SIMON THE SORCERER</h1><h4>Give me also this power, that whomever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit.</h4><p><u>20</u>But Peter said to him,</p><h1>SIMON PETER</h1><h3>May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! <u>21</u>You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart isn’t right before God. <u>22</u>Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you. <u>23</u>For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity.</h3><p>   <u>24</u>Simon answered,</p><h1>SIMON THE SORCERER</h1><h4>Pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you have spoken happen to me.</h4><p>   <u>25</u>They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans. <u>26</u>But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying,</p><h1>AN ANGEL</h1><h4>Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert.</h4><p>   <u>27</u>He arose and went; and behold, there was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship. <u>28</u>He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.<br />   <u>29</u>The Spirit said to Philip,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Go near, and join yourself to this chariot.</h2><p>   <u>30</u>Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said,</p><h1>PHILIP THE EVANGELIST</h1><h3>Do you understand what you are reading?</h3><p>   <u>31</u>He said,</p><h1>THE ETHIOPIAN EUNUCH</h1><h4>How can I, unless someone explains it to me?</h4><p>He begged Philip to come up and sit with him. <u>32</u>Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this,<br />   He was led as a sheep to the slaughter.<br />   As a lamb before his shearer is silent,<br />   so he doesn’t open his mouth.<br />   <u>33</u>In his humiliation, his judgment was taken away.<br />   Who will declare His generation?<br />   For his life is taken from the earth.”*<br />   <u>34</u>The eunuch answered Philip,</p><h1>THE ETHIOPIAN EUNUCH</h1><h4>Who is the prophet talking about? About himself, or about someone else?</h4><p>   <u>35</u>Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached to him Jesus. <u>36</u>As they went on the way, they came to some water, and the eunuch said,</p><h1>THE ETHIOPIAN EUNUCH</h1><h4>Behold, here is water. What is keeping me from being baptized?</h4><p>   <u>37</u>* <u>38</u>He commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.<br />   <u>39</u>When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch didn’t see him any more, for he went on his way rejoicing. <u>40</u>But Philip was found at Azotus. Passing through, he preached the Good News to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.<br />   <strong>9</strong><u>1</u>But Saul, still breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest, <u>2</u>and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. <u>3</u>As he traveled, he got close to Damascus, and suddenly a light from the sky shone around him. <u>4</u>He fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to him,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?</h2><p>   <u>5</u>He said,</p><h1>PAUL</h1><h3>Who are you, Lord?</h3><p>   The Lord said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.* <u>6</u>But* rise up, and enter into the city, and you will be told what you must do.</h2><p>   <u>7</u>The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the sound, but seeing no one. <u>8</u>Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no one. They led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. <u>9</u>He was without sight for three days, and neither ate nor drank.<br />   <u>10</u>Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Ananias!</h2><p>   He said,</p><h1>ANANIAS OF DAMASCUS</h1><h4>Behold, it’s me, Lord.</h4><p>   <u>11</u>The Lord said to him,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judah* for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus. For behold, he is praying, <u>12</u>and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight.</h2><p>   <u>13</u>But Ananias answered,</p><h1>ANANIAS OF DAMASCUS</h1><h4>Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he did to your saints at Jerusalem. <u>14</u>Here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.</h4><p>   <u>15</u>But the Lord said to him,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Go your way, for he is my chosen vessel to bear my name before the nations and kings, and the children of Israel. <u>16</u>For I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name’s sake.</h2><p>   <u>17</u>Ananias departed, and entered into the house. Laying his hands on him, he said,</p><h1>ANANIAS OF DAMASCUS</h1><h4>Brother Saul, the Lord, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.</h4><p><u>18</u>Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he received his sight. He arose and was baptized. <u>19</u>He took food and was strengthened. Saul stayed several days with the disciples who were at Damascus. <u>20</u>Immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed the Christ, that he is the Son of God. <u>21</u>All who heard him were amazed, and said,</p><h1>JEWS IN DAMASCUS</h1><h4>Isn’t this he who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called on this name? And he had come here intending to bring them bound before the chief priests!</h4><p>   <u>22</u>But Saul increased more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ. <u>23</u>When many days were fulfilled, the Jews conspired together to kill him, <u>24</u>but their plot became known to Saul. They watched the gates both day and night that they might kill him, <u>25</u>but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket. <u>26</u>When Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. <u>27</u>But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus. <u>28</u>He was with them entering into* Jerusalem, <u>29</u>preaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus.* He spoke and disputed against the Hellenists,* but they were seeking to kill him. <u>30</u>When the brothers* knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him off to Tarsus. <u>31</u>So the assemblies throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, and were built up. They were multiplied, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.</p><h5>*Acts 8:33 Isaiah 53:7,8<br />*Acts 8:37 TR adds “Philip said, ‘If you believe with all your heart, you may.’ He answered, ‘I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.’”<br />*Acts 9:5 TR adds “It’s hard for you to kick against the goads.”<br />*Acts 9:6 TR omits “But”<br />*Acts 9:11 or, Judas<br />*Acts 9:28 TR and NU add “and going out”<br />*Acts 9:29 TR and NU omit “Jesus” and reverse the order of verses 28 &amp; 29.<br />*Acts 9:29 The Hellenists were Hebrews who used Greek language and culture.<br />*Acts 9:30 The word for “brothers” here and where the context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”</h5>",path:"/355",Question1:"List all the questions raised in the text.
