Lightnings, sounds, thunders, an earthquake, and great hail followed.<br />   <strong>12</strong><u>1</u>A great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. <u>2</u>She was with child. She cried out in pain, laboring to give birth. <u>3</u>Another sign was seen in heaven. Behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns. <u>4</u>His tail drew one third of the stars of the sky, and threw them to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child. <u>5</u>She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron. Her child was caught up to God, and to his throne. <u>6</u>The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that there they may nourish her one thousand two hundred sixty days.<br />   <u>7</u>There was war in the sky. Michael and his angels made war on the dragon. The dragon and his angels made war. <u>8</u>They didn’t prevail, neither was a place found for him any more in heaven. <u>9</u>The great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. <u>10</u>I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Now the salvation, the power, and the Kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ has come; for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them before our God day and night. <u>11</u>They overcame him because of the Lamb’s blood, and because of the word of their testimony. They didn’t love their life, even to death. <u>12</u>Therefore rejoice, heavens, and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil has gone down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time.</h2><p>   <u>13</u>When the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child. <u>14</u>Two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, so that she might be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. <u>15</u>The serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream. <u>16</u>The earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out of his mouth. <u>17</u>The dragon grew angry with the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her offspring,* who keep God’s commandments and hold Jesus’ testimony.<br />   <strong>13</strong><u>1</u>Then I stood on the sand of the sea. I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten crowns, and on his heads, blasphemous names. <u>2</u>The beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority. <u>3</u>One of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally. His fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled at the beast. <u>4</u>They worshiped the dragon, because he gave his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying,</p><h1>ALL PEOPLE</h1><h4>Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?</h4><p><u>5</u>A mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him. Authority to make war for forty-two months was given to him. <u>6</u>He opened his mouth for blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his dwelling, those who dwell in heaven. <u>7</u>It was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them. Authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation was given to him. <u>8</u>All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been killed. <u>9</u>If anyone has an ear, let him hear. <u>10</u>If anyone is to go into captivity, he will go into captivity. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, he must be killed.* Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.<br />   <u>11</u>I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon. <u>12</u>He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. He makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed. <u>13</u>He performs great signs, even making fire come down out of the sky to the earth in the sight of people. <u>14</u>He deceives my own* people who dwell on the earth because of the signs he was granted to do in front of the beast; saying to those who dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who had the sword wound and lived. <u>15</u>It was given to him to give breath to it, to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause as many as wouldn’t worship the image of the beast to be killed. <u>16</u>He causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave, to be given marks on their right hands, or on their foreheads; <u>17</u>and that no one would be able to buy or to sell, unless he has that mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name. <u>18</u>Here is wisdom. He who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. His number is six hundred sixty-six.<br />   <strong>14</strong><u>1</u>I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him a number, one hundred forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads. <u>2</u>I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a great thunder. The sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps. <u>3</u>They sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth. <u>4</u>These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed by Jesus from among men, the first fruits to God and to the Lamb. <u>5</u>In their mouth was found no lie, for they are blameless.*<br />   <u>6</u>I saw an angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal Good News to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, tribe, language, and people. <u>7</u>He said with a loud voice,</p><h1>A FIRST ANGEL FLYING</h1><h4>Fear the Lord, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters!</h4><p>   <u>8</u>Another, a second angel, followed, saying,</p><h1>A SECOND ANGEL FLYING</h1><h4>Babylon the great has fallen, which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality.</h4><p>   <u>9</u>Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice,</p><h1>A THIRD ANGEL FLYING</h1><h4>If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead, or on his hand, <u>10</u>he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb. <u>11</u>The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. They have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name. <u>12</u>Here is the patience of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</h4><p>   <u>13</u>I heard the voice from heaven saying,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Write, ‘Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.’<br />   Yes,” says the Spirit, “that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.</h2><p>   <u>14</u>I looked, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man,* having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. <u>15</u>Another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud,</p><h1>AN ANGEL FROM THE TEMPLE</h1><h4>Send your sickle, and reap; for the hour to reap has come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe!</h4><p><u>16</u>He who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.<br />   <u>17</u>Another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven. He also had a sharp sickle. <u>18</u>Another angel came out from the altar, he who has power over fire, and he called with a great voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying,</p><h1>AN ANGEL WITH A SICKLE</h1><h4>Send your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for the earth’s grapes are fully ripe!</h4><p><u>19</u>The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of God. <u>20</u>The wine press was trodden outside of the city, and blood came out of the wine press, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as one thousand six hundred stadia.*</p><h5>*Revelation 12:17 or, seed<br />*Revelation 13:10 TR reads “If anyone leads into captivity, into captivity he goes.
