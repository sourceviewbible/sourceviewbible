Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne <u>3</u>that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at. <u>4</u>Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads. <u>5</u>Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. <u>6</u>Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In the middle of the throne, and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind. <u>7</u>The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle. <u>8</u>The four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within. They have no rest day and night, saying,</p><h1>FOUR LIVING BEINGS</h1><h4>Holy, holy, holy* is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come!”</h4><p>   <u>9</u>When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever, <u>10</u>the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and throw their crowns before the throne, saying,</p><h1>24 ELDERS</h1><h4><u>11</u>Worthy are you, our Lord and God, the Holy One,* to receive the glory, the honor, and the power, for you created all things, and because of your desire they existed, and were created!</h4><p>   <strong>5</strong><u>1</u>I saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book written inside and outside, sealed shut with seven seals. <u>2</u>I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice,</p><h1>A STRONG ANGEL</h1><h4>Who is worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?</h4><p><u>3</u>No one in heaven above, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look in it. <u>4</u>And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look in it. <u>5</u>One of the elders said to me,</p><h1>ONE OF THE 24 ELDERS</h1><h4>Don’t weep. Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome; he who opens the book and its seven seals.</h4><p><u>6</u>I saw in the middle of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the middle of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth. <u>7</u>Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne. <u>8</u>Now when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. <u>9</u>They sang a new song, saying,</p><h1>FOUR LIVING BEINGS &amp; 24 ELDERS</h1><h4>   You are worthy to take the book,<br />   and to open its seals:<br />   for you were killed,<br />   and bought us for God with your blood,<br />   out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,<br />   <u>10</u>and made us kings and priests to our God,<br />   and we will reign on earth.</h4><p>   <u>11</u>I saw, and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands; <u>12</u>saying with a loud voice,</p><h1>MILLIONS OF ANGELS</h1><h4>Worthy is the Lamb who has been killed to receive the power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing!</h4><p>   <u>13</u>I heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying,</p><h1>EVERY CREATURE</h1><h4>To him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion, forever and ever! Amen!*</h4><p>   <u>14</u>The four living creatures said,</p><h1>FOUR LIVING BEINGS</h1><h4>Amen!</h4><p>Then the * elders fell down and worshiped.*<br />   <strong>6</strong><u>1</u>I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder,</p><h1>FIRST LIVING BEING</h1><h4>Come and see!</h4><p><u>2</u>And behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow. A crown was given to him, and he came out conquering, and to conquer.<br />   <u>3</u>When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying,</p><h1>SECOND LIVING BEING</h1><h4>Come!</h4><p><u>4</u>Another came out, a red horse. To him who sat on it was given power to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. There was given to him a great sword.<br />   <u>5</u>When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying,</p><h1>THIRD LIVING BEING</h1><h4>Come and see!</h4><p>And behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand. <u>6</u>I heard a voice in the middle of the four living creatures saying,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>A choenix* of wheat for a denarius, and three choenix of barley for a denarius! Don’t damage the oil and the wine!</h2><p>   <u>7</u>When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature saying,</p><h1>FORTH LIVING BEING</h1><h4>Come and see!</h4><p><u>8</u>And behold, a pale horse, and he who sat on it, his name was Death. Hades* followed with him. Authority over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, with famine, with death, and by the wild animals of the earth was given to him.<br />   <u>9</u>When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God, and for the testimony of the Lamb which they had. <u>10</u>They cried with a loud voice, saying,</p><h1>ALL THE MARTYRS</h1><h4>How long, Master, the holy and true, until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?</h4><p><u>11</u>A long white robe was given to each of them. They were told that they should rest yet for a while, until their fellow servants and their brothers,* who would also be killed even as they were, should complete their course.<br />   <u>12</u>I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became as blood. <u>13</u>The stars of the sky fell to the earth, like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind. <u>14</u>The sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up. Every mountain and island were moved out of their places. <u>15</u>The kings of the earth, the princes, the commanding officers, the rich, the strong, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains. <u>16</u>They told the mountains and the rocks,</p><h1>ALL PEOPLE</h1><h4>Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, <u>17</u>for the great day of his wrath has come; and who is able to stand?</h4><p>   <strong>7</strong><u>1</u>After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree. <u>2</u>I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise, having the seal of the living God. He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea, <u>3</u>saying,</p><h1>AN ANGEL FROM THE EAST</h1><h4>Don’t harm the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads!</h4><p><u>4</u>I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel:<br />   <u>5</u>of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand,<br />   of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand,<br />   of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,<br />   <u>6</u>of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand,<br />   of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand,<br />   of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,<br />   <u>7</u>of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand,<br />   of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand,<br />   of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,<br />   <u>8</u>of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand,<br />   of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand,<br />   of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.<br />   <u>9</u>After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of all tribes, peoples, and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands. <u>10</u>They cried with a loud voice, saying,</p><h1>ALL THE REDEEMED</h1><h4>Salvation be to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!</h4><p>   <u>11</u>All the angels were standing around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before his throne, and worshiped God, <u>12</u>saying,</p><h1>ALL THE ANGELS</h1><h4>Amen! Blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and might, be to our God forever and ever! Amen.</h4><p>   <u>13</u>One of the elders answered, saying to me,</p><h1>ONE OF THE 24 ELDERS</h1><h4>These who are arrayed in white robes, who are they, and from where did they come?</h4><p>   <u>14</u>I told him,</p><h1>JOHN THE DISCIPLE</h1><h3>My lord, you know.</h3><p>   He said to me,</p><h1>ONE OF THE 24 ELDERS</h1><h4>These are those who came out of the great tribulation. They washed their robes, and made them white in the Lamb’s blood. <u>15</u>Therefore they are before the throne of God, they serve him day and night in his temple. He who sits on the throne will spread his tabernacle over them. <u>16</u>They will never be hungry, neither thirsty any more; neither will the sun beat on them, nor any heat; <u>17</u>for the Lamb who is in the middle of the throne shepherds them, and leads them to springs of waters of life. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.</h4><p>   <strong>8</strong><u>1</u>When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.</p><h5>*Revelation 4:8 Hodges/Farstad MT reads “holy” 9 times instead of 3.<br />*Revelation 4:11 TR omits “and God, the Holy One,”<br />*Revelation 5:13 TR omits “Amen!”<br />*Revelation 5:14 TR adds “twenty-four”<br />*Revelation 5:14 TR adds “the one living forever and ever”<br />*Revelation 6:6 A choenix is a dry volume measure that is a little more than a liter (a little more than a quart).<br />*Revelation 6:8 or, Hell<br />*Revelation 6:11 The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”</h5>",path:"/426",Question1:"List all the questions raised in the text.
