Kneeling down on the beach, we prayed. <u>6</u>After saying goodbye to each other, we went on board the ship, and they returned home again.<br />   <u>7</u>When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. We greeted the brothers, and stayed with them one day. <u>8</u>On the next day, we, who were Paul’s companions, departed, and came to Caesarea.<br />   We entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him. <u>9</u>Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied. <u>10</u>As we stayed there some days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. <u>11</u>Coming to us, and taking Paul’s belt, he bound his own feet and hands, and said,</p><h1>AGABUS THE PROPHET</h1><h4>Thus says the Holy Spirit: ‘So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’</h4><p>   <u>12</u>When we heard these things, both we and they of that place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem. <u>13</u>Then Paul answered,</p><h1>PAUL</h1><h3>What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</h3><p>   <u>14</u>When he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying,</p><h1>BELIEVERS IN CAESAREA</h1><h4>The Lord’s will be done.</h4><p>   <u>15</u>After these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem. <u>16</u>Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, bringing one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we would stay.</p><h5>*Acts 19:19 The 50,000 pieces of silver here probably referred to 50,000 drachmas.
