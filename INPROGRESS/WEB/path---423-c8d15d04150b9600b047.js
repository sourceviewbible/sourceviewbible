They are destroyed in these things that they understand naturally, like the creatures without reason. <u>11</u>Woe to them! For they went in the way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and perished in Korah’s rebellion. <u>12</u>These are hidden rocky reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you, shepherds who without fear feed themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn leaves without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; <u>13</u>wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever. <u>14</u>About these also Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, “Behold,* the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones, <u>15</u>to execute judgment on all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.” <u>16</u>These are murmurers and complainers, walking after their lusts (and their mouth speaks proud things), showing respect of persons to gain advantage.<br />   <u>17</u>But you, beloved, remember the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. <u>18</u>They said to you that “In the last time there will be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts.” <u>19</u>These are they who cause divisions, and are sensual, not having the Spirit. <u>20</u>But you, beloved, keep building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit. <u>21</u>Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life. <u>22</u>On some have compassion, making a distinction, <u>23</u>and some save, snatching them out of the fire with fear, hating even the clothing stained by the flesh.<br />   <u>24</u>Now to him who is able to keep them* from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory in great joy, <u>25</u>to God our Savior, who alone is wise, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen.</p><h5>*Jude 1:1 or, Judah<br />*Jude 1:14 “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.
