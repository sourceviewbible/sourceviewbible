Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne. <u>4</u>The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand. <u>5</u>The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it on the earth. There followed thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake.<br />   <u>6</u>The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. <u>7</u>The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. One third of the earth was burnt up,* and one third of the trees were burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.<br />   <u>8</u>The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood, <u>9</u>and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died. One third of the ships were destroyed.<br />   <u>10</u>The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters. <u>11</u>The name of the star is called “Wormwood.” One third of the waters became wormwood. Many people died from the waters, because they were made bitter.<br />   <u>12</u>The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck, and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn’t shine for one third of it, and the night in the same way. <u>13</u>I saw, and I heard an eagle,* flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice,</p><h1>AN EAGLE</h1><h4>Woe! Woe! Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!</h4><p>   <strong>9</strong><u>1</u>The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth. The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him. <u>2</u>He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke from a* burning furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit. <u>3</u>Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. <u>4</u>They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people who don’t have God’s seal on their foreheads. <u>5</u>They were given power not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a person. <u>6</u>In those days people will seek death, and will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them. <u>7</u>The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like golden crowns, and their faces were like people’s faces. <u>8</u>They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions. <u>9</u>They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war. <u>10</u>They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In their tails they have power to harm men for five months. <u>11</u>They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is “Abaddon”,* but in Greek, he has the name “Apollyon”.* <u>12</u>The first woe is past. Behold, there are still two woes coming after this.<br />   <u>13</u>The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God, <u>14</u>saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!</h2><p>   <u>15</u>The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill one third of mankind. <u>16</u>The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million.* I heard the number of them. <u>17</u>Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of lions. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur. <u>18</u>By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths. <u>19</u>For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they harm. <u>20</u>The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, didn’t repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn’t worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk. <u>21</u>They didn’t repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries,* nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts.<br />   <strong>10</strong><u>1</u>I saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky, clothed with a cloud. A rainbow was on his head. His face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire. <u>2</u>He had in his hand a little open book. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land. <u>3</u>He cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars. When he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices. <u>4</u>When the seven thunders sounded, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from the sky saying,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Seal up the things which the seven thunders said, and don’t write them.</h2><p>   <u>5</u>The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the sky, <u>6</u>and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there will no longer be delay, <u>7</u>but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as he declared to his servants, the prophets. <u>8</u>The voice which I heard from heaven, again speaking with me, said,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.</h2><p>   <u>9</u>I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book.<br />   He said to me,</p><h1>A MIGHTY ANGEL STANDING</h1><h4>Take it, and eat it up. It will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.</h4><p>   <u>10</u>I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth. When I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter. <u>11</u>They told me,</p><h1>A MIGHTY ANGEL STANDING</h1><h4>You must prophesy again over many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.</h4><p>   <strong>11</strong><u>1</u>A reed like a rod was given to me. Someone said,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Rise, and measure God’s temple, and the altar, and those who worship in it. <u>2</u>Leave out the court which is outside of the temple, and don’t measure it, for it has been given to the nations. They will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months. <u>3</u>I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.</h2><p><u>4</u>These are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands, standing before the Lord of the earth. <u>5</u>If anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. If anyone desires to harm them, he must be killed in this way. <u>6</u>These have the power to shut up the sky, that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy. They have power over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire. <u>7</u>When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them. <u>8</u>Their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. <u>9</u>From among the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb. <u>10</u>Those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and they will be glad. They will give gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth. <u>11</u>After the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet. Great fear fell on those who saw them. <u>12</u>I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Come up here!</h2><p>They went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them. <u>13</u>In that day there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven. <u>14</u>The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe comes quickly.<br />   <u>15</u>The seventh angel sounded, and great voices in heaven followed, saying,</p><h1>A SEVENTH ANGEL</h1><h4>The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ. He will reign forever and ever!</h4><p>   <u>16</u>The twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God’s throne, fell on their faces and worshiped God, <u>17</u>saying:</p><h1>24 ELDERS</h1><h4>We give you thanks, Lord God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was*; because you have taken your great power, and reigned. <u>18</u>The nations were angry, and your wrath came, as did the time for the dead to be judged, and to give your bondservants the prophets, their reward, as well as to the saints, and those who fear your name, to the small and the great; and to destroy those who destroy the earth.</h4><h5>*Revelation 8:7 TR omits “One third of the earth was burnt up”<br />*Revelation 8:13 TR reads “angel” instead of “eagle”<br />*Revelation 9:2 TR adds “great”<br />*Revelation 9:11 “Abaddon” is a Hebrew word that means “ruin”, “destruction”, or “the place of destruction”<br />*Revelation 9:11 “Apollyon” means “Destroyer”.<br />*Revelation 9:16 literally, “ten thousands of ten thousands”<br />*Revelation 9:21 The word for “sorceries” (pharmakeia) also implies the use of potions, poisons, and drugs<br />*Revelation 11:17 TR adds “and who is coming”</h5>\",\"path\":\"/427\",\"Question1\":\"With which character do you most identify in this passage?
