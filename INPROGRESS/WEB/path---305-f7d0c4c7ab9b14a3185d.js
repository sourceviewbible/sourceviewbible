The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother; <u>3</u>Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, who was also called* Thaddaeus; <u>4</u>Simon the Canaanite; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.<br />   <u>5</u>Jesus sent these twelve out, and commanded them, saying,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Don’t go among the Gentiles, and don’t enter into any city of the Samaritans. <u>6</u>Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. <u>7</u>As you go, preach, saying, ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!’ <u>8</u>Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers,* and cast out demons. Freely you received, so freely give. <u>9</u>Don’t take any gold, silver, or brass in your money belts. <u>10</u>Take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food. <u>11</u>Into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you go on. <u>12</u>As you enter into the household, greet it. <u>13</u>If the household is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it isn’t worthy, let your peace return to you. <u>14</u>Whoever doesn’t receive you, nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake off the dust from your feet. <u>15</u>Most certainly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.<br />   <u>16</u>Behold, I send you out as sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. <u>17</u>But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you. <u>18</u>Yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations. <u>19</u>But when they deliver you up, don’t be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say. <u>20</u>For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.<br />   <u>21</u>Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death. <u>22</u>You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved. <u>23</u>But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next, for most certainly I tell you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man has come.<br />   <u>24</u>A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord. <u>25</u>It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul,* how much more those of his household! <u>26</u>Therefore don’t be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hidden that will not be known. <u>27</u>What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops. <u>28</u>Don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.*<br />   <u>29</u>Aren’t two sparrows sold for an assarion coin?* Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father’s will, <u>30</u>but the very hairs of your head are all numbered. <u>31</u>Therefore don’t be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows. <u>32</u>Everyone therefore who confesses me before men, him I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven. <u>33</u>But whoever denies me before men, him I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven.<br />   <u>34</u>Don’t think that I came to send peace on the earth. I didn’t come to send peace, but a sword. <u>35</u>For I came to set a man at odds against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. <u>36</u>A man’s foes will be those of his own household.* <u>37</u>He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me isn’t worthy of me. <u>38</u>He who doesn’t take his cross and follow after me, isn’t worthy of me. <u>39</u>He who seeks his life will lose it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it. <u>40</u>He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me. <u>41</u>He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward. He who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward. <u>42</u>Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward.</h2><p>   <strong>11</strong><u>1</u>When Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.</p><h5>*Matthew 9:36 TR reads “weary” instead of “harassed”<br />*Matthew 10:3 NU omits “Lebbaeus, who was also called”<br />*Matthew 10:8 TR adds “raise the dead,”<br />*Matthew 10:25 Literally, Lord of the Flies, or the devil<br />*Matthew 10:28 or, Hell.<br />*Matthew 10:29 An assarion is a small coin worth one tenth of a drachma or a sixteenth of a denarius.
