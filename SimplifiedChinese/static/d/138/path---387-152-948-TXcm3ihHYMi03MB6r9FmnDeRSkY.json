For we are members of one another. <u>26</u>“Be angry, and don’t sin.”* Don’t let the sun go down on your wrath, <u>27</u>and don’t give place to the devil. <u>28</u>Let him who stole steal no more; but rather let him labor, producing with his hands something that is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need. <u>29</u>Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but only what is good for building others up as the need may be, that it may give grace to those who hear. <u>30</u>Don’t grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. <u>31</u>Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, outcry, and slander, be put away from you, with all malice. <u>32</u>And be kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving each other, just as God also in Christ forgave you.<br />   <strong>5</strong><u>1</u>Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children. <u>2</u>Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance. <u>3</u>But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints; <u>4</u>nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks.<br />   <u>5</u>Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God.<br />   <u>6</u>Let no one deceive you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience. <u>7</u>Therefore don’t be partakers with them. <u>8</u>For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light, <u>9</u>for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth, <u>10</u>proving what is well pleasing to the Lord. <u>11</u>Have no fellowship with the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather even reprove them. <u>12</u>For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of. <u>13</u>But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light. <u>14</u>Therefore he says, “Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”<br />   <u>15</u>Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise; <u>16</u>redeeming the time, because the days are evil. <u>17</u>Therefore don’t be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. <u>18</u>Don’t be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit, <u>19</u>speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and making melody in your heart to the Lord; <u>20</u>giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father; <u>21</u>subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ.<br />   <u>22</u>Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord. <u>23</u>For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body. <u>24</u>But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything.<br />   <u>25</u>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it; <u>26</u>that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word, <u>27</u>that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without defect. <u>28</u>Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself. <u>29</u>For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly; <u>30</u>because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones. <u>31</u>“For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife. The two will become one flesh.”* <u>32</u>This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and of the assembly. <u>33</u>Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.<br />   <strong>6</strong><u>1</u>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. <u>2</u>“Honor your father and mother,” which is the first commandment with a promise: <u>3</u>“that it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth.”*<br />   <u>4</u>You fathers, don’t provoke your children to wrath, but nurture them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.<br />   <u>5</u>Servants, be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ; <u>6</u>not in the way of service only when eyes are on you, as men pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; <u>7</u>with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men; <u>8</u>knowing that whatever good thing each one does, he will receive the same again from the Lord, whether he is bound or free.<br />   <u>9</u>You masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with him.<br />   <u>10</u>Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might. <u>11</u>Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. <u>12</u>For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world’s rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. <u>13</u>Therefore put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand. <u>14</u>Stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, <u>15</u>and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News of peace; <u>16</u>above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one. <u>17</u>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word* of God; <u>18</u>with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints: <u>19</u>on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the Good News, <u>20</u>for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.<br />   <u>21</u>But that you also may know my affairs, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make known to you all things; <u>22</u>whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.<br />   <u>23</u>Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <u>24</u>Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love.
