This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it. <u>7</u>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist. <u>8</u>Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward. <u>9</u>Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn’t have God. He who remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son. <u>10</u>If anyone comes to you, and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him, <u>11</u>for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds.<br />   <u>12</u>Having many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full. <u>13</u>The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.</p>","questionsTitle":"DIGGING DEEPER","Question1":"About whom does John issue a warning?","Question2":"How does John encourage the church to guard against deception?","Question3":"Are there people that you should not be listening to?","Question4":"How can you abide in the teaching of Christ?","prevPath":"/418","nextPath":"/420"}},"pageContext":{}}
