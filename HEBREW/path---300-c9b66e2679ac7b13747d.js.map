In the culture in which she lived, Ruth had three strikes against her: At that time people honored women with children; she had none. Women were dependent on their husbands; she was a widow.

Take special note of the deep love that binds Ruth and Naomi, a love strengthened through suffering.

In Naomi 14 (her longest speaking part), Naomi is at her match-making best! It contains her instructions to Ruth to woo Boaz, offering herself to him as a marriage prospect (in Hebrew to “uncover his feet” is an idiomatic expression which means to “offer oneself romantically” to another). In Boaz 10 (his longest speaking part), Boaz responds to Ruth’s romantic advance and commits himself to make arrangements to marry her as quickly as possible! Clearly their union in marriage is the principle idea of this love story.<br />   One more interesting point. There are several women who speak in this book: Naomi, Ruth (at times alone and at times along with Orpah), and the women of Bethlehem. There are also several men who speak in this book: Boaz, and his harvesters and foreman, his relative and witnesses. The words of all the women total 713; those of all the men only 691. In books written in antiquity women’s voices are rarely heard. The fact that God’s inspired record of this romance not only includes the perspective of women, but gives them more voice than the men in this love story is truly remarkable.</p>\",\"path\":\"/300\",\"Question1\":null,\"Question2\":null,\"Question3\":null,\"Question4\":null,\"prevPath\":\"/\",\"nextPath\":\"/301\"}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---300-c9b66e2679ac7b13747d.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"postsJson\":{\"title\":\"Introduction to Ruth / רות\",\"questionsTitle\":null,\"display\":\"none\",\"bookName\":\"Ruth / רות\",\"ref\":null,\"html\":\"<h6 style='text-align: left'>A surprising love story</h6><p style='text-align: left'>An outsider’s loyalty shapes the destiny of future generations</p><h6 style='text-align: left'>How to read Ruth</h6><p style='text-align: left'>If you’ve ever felt like an outsider, struggling to fit in, then you’ll identify with Ruth, the heroine of this book.
