This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. <u>26</u>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.* <u>27</u>He came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law, <u>28</u>then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,</p><h1>SIMEON</h1><h4><p>   <u>29</u>Now you are releasing your servant, Master,<br />   according to your word, in peace;<br />   <u>30</u>for my eyes have seen your salvation,<br />   <u>31</u>which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;<br />   <u>32</u>a light for revelation to the nations,<br />   and the glory of your people Israel.</h4><p>   <u>33</u>Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him, <u>34</u>and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother,</p><h1>SIMEON</h1><h4>Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against. <u>35</u>Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</h4><p>   <u>36</u>There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity, <u>37</u>and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who didn’t depart from the temple, worshiping with fastings and petitions night and day. <u>38</u>Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.<br />   <u>39</u>When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth. <u>40</u>The child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</p><h5>*Luke 1:20 “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.
