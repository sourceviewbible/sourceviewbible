But now we don’t see all things subjected to him, yet. <u>9</u>But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone. <u>10</u>For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many children to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings. <u>11</u>For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,* <u>12</u>saying,<br />   I will declare your name to my brothers.<br />   Among of the congregation I will sing your praise.”*<br />   <u>13</u>Again, “I will put my trust in him.”* Again, “Behold, here I am with the children whom God has given me.”* <u>14</u>Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in the same way partook of the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, <u>15</u>and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. <u>16</u>For most certainly, he doesn’t give help to angels, but he gives help to the offspring* of Abraham. <u>17</u>Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people. <u>18</u>For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.<br />   <strong>3</strong><u>1</u>Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus; <u>2</u>who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house. <u>3</u>For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who built the house has more honor than the house. <u>4</u>For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God. <u>5</u>Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken, <u>6</u>but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end. <u>7</u>Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says,<br />   Today if you will hear his voice,<br />   <u>8</u>don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion,<br />   like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,<br />   <u>9</u>where your fathers tested me by proving me,<br />   and saw my deeds for forty years.<br />   <u>10</u>Therefore I was displeased with that generation,<br />   and said, ‘They always err in their heart,<br />   but they didn’t know my ways;’<br />   <u>11</u>as I swore in my wrath,<br />   ‘They will not enter into my rest.’”*<br />   <u>12</u>Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God; <u>13</u>but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called “today”; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. <u>14</u>For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end: <u>15</u>while it is said,<br />   Today if you will hear his voice,<br />   don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.”*<br />   <u>16</u>For who, when they heard, rebelled? No, didn’t all those who came out of Egypt by Moses? <u>17</u>With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn’t it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? <u>18</u>To whom did he swear that they wouldn’t enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient? <u>19</u>We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.<br />   <strong>4</strong><u>1</u>Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest. <u>2</u>For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard didn’t profit them, because it wasn’t mixed with faith by those who heard. <u>3</u>For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, “As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest”;* although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. <u>4</u>For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, “God rested on the seventh day from all his works”;* <u>5</u>and in this place again, “They will not enter into my rest.”*<br />   <u>6</u>Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein, and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience, <u>7</u>he again defines a certain day, today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said),<br />   Today if you will hear his voice,<br />   don’t harden your hearts.”*<br />   <u>8</u>For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day. <u>9</u>There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God. <u>10</u>For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his. <u>11</u>Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience. <u>12</u>For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.<br />   <u>13</u>There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him to whom we must give an account.</p><h5>*Hebrews 1:5 Psalm 2:7<br />*Hebrews 1:5 2 Samuel 7:14; 1 Chronicles 17:13<br />*Hebrews 1:6 Deuteronomy 32:43 LXX<br />*Hebrews 1:7 Psalm 104:4<br />*Hebrews 1:9 Psalm 45:6-7<br />*Hebrews 1:12 Psalm 102:25-27<br />*Hebrews 1:13 Psalm 110:1<br />*Hebrews 2:7 TR adds “and set him over the works of your hands”<br />*Hebrews 2:8 Psalm 8:4-6<br />*Hebrews 2:11 The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”<br />*Hebrews 2:12 Psalm 22:22<br />*Hebrews 2:13 Isaiah 8:17<br />*Hebrews 2:13 Isaiah 8:18<br />*Hebrews 2:16 or, seed<br />*Hebrews 3:11 Psalm 95:7-11<br />*Hebrews 3:15 Psalm 95:7-8<br />*Hebrews 4:3 Psalm 95:11<br />*Hebrews 4:4 Genesis 2:2<br />*Hebrews 4:5 Psalm 95:11<br />*Hebrews 4:7 Psalm 95:7-8</h5>",path:"/405",Question1:"List all the many questions raised in this passage.
