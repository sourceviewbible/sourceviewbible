If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.</h4><p><u>5</u>For even his brothers didn’t believe in him. <br />   <u>6</u>Jesus therefore said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready. <u>7</u>The world can’t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil. <u>8</u>You go up to the feast.

Some said,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>He is a good man.</h4><p>Others said,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.</h4><p><u>13</u>Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews. <u>14</u>But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. <u>15</u>The Jews therefore marveled, saying,</p><h1>JEWISH LEADERS</h1><h4>How does this man know letters, having never been educated?</h4><p>   <u>16</u>Jesus therefore answered them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. <u>17</u>If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself. <u>18</u>He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. <u>19</u>Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?</h2><p>   <u>20</u>The multitude answered,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?</h4><p>   <u>21</u>Jesus answered them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>I did one work, and you all marvel because of it. <u>22</u>Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy. <u>23</u>If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath? <u>24</u>Don’t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</h2><p>   <u>25</u>Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill? <u>26</u>Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him.

I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don’t know. <u>29</u>I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.</h2><p>   <u>30</u>They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. <u>31</u>But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>When the Christ comes, he won’t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?</h4><p><u>32</u>The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. <br />   <u>33</u>Then Jesus said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me. <u>34</u>You will seek me, and won’t find me; and where I am, you can’t come.</h2><p>   <u>35</u>The Jews therefore said among themselves,</p><h1>JEWISH LEADERS</h1><h4>Where will this man go that we won’t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? <u>36</u>What is this word that he said, ‘You will seek me, and won’t find me; and where I am, you can’t come’?</h4><p>   <u>37</u>Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink! <u>38</u>He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.</h2><p><u>39</u>But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified. <br />   <u>40</u>Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>This is truly the prophet.</h4><p><u>41</u>Others said,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>This is the Christ.</h4><p>But some said,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>What, does the Christ come out of Galilee? <u>42</u>Hasn’t the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the offspring* of David,* and from Bethlehem,* the village where David was?</h4><p><u>43</u>So there arose a division in the multitude because of him. <u>44</u>Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him. <u>45</u>The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them,</p><h1>JEWISH LEADERS</h1><h4>Why didn’t you bring him?</h4><p>   <u>46</u>The officers answered,</p><h1>THE TEMPLE GUARDS</h1><h4>No man ever spoke like this man!</h4><p>   <u>47</u>The Pharisees therefore answered them,</p><h1>THE PHARISEES</h1><h4>You aren’t also led astray, are you? <u>48</u>Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees? <u>49</u>But this multitude that doesn’t know the law is accursed.</h4><p>   <u>50</u>Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them,</p><h1>NICODEMUS</h1><h4><u>51</u>Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?</h4><p>   <u>52</u>They answered him,</p><h1>THE PHARISEES</h1><h4>Are you also from Galilee?

He sat down, and taught them. <u>3</u>The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the middle, <u>4</u>they told him,</p><h1>JEWISH LEADERS</h1><h4>Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act. <u>5</u>Now in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.* What then do you say about her?</h4><p><u>6</u>They said this testing him, that they might have something to accuse him of. <br />   But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger. <u>7</u>But when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her.</h2><p><u>8</u>Again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. <br />   <u>9</u>They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle. <u>10</u>Jesus, standing up, saw her and said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one condemn you?</h2><p>   <u>11</u>She said,</p><h1>AN ADULTEROUS WOMAN</h1><h4>No one, Lord.</h4><p>   Jesus said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin no more.</h2><p>   <u>12</u>Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>I am the light of the world.* He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.</h2><p>   <u>13</u>The Pharisees therefore said to him,</p><h1>THE PHARISEES</h1><h4>You testify about yourself. Your testimony is not valid.</h4><p>   <u>14</u>Jesus answered them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you don’t know where I came from, or where I am going. <u>15</u>You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one. <u>16</u>Even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me. <u>17</u>It’s also written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid.* <u>18</u>I am one who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me.</h2><p>   <u>19</u>They said therefore to him,</p><h1>THE PHARISEES</h1><h4>Where is your Father?</h4><p>   Jesus answered,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>You know neither me, nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.</h2><p><u>20</u>Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come. <u>21</u>Jesus said therefore again to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I go, you can’t come.</h2><p>   <u>22</u>The Jews therefore said,</p><h1>JEWISH LEADERS</h1><h4>Will he kill himself, that he says, ‘Where I am going, you can’t come’?</h4><p>   <u>23</u>He said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world. <u>24</u>I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am* he, you will die in your sins.</h2><p>   <u>25</u>They said therefore to him,</p><h1>JEWISH LEADERS</h1><h4>Who are you?</h4><p>   Jesus said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning. <u>26</u>I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I say to the world.</h2><p>   <u>27</u>They didn’t understand that he spoke to them about the Father. <u>28</u>Jesus therefore said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing of myself, but as my Father taught me, I say these things. <u>29</u>He who sent me is with me. The Father hasn’t left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.</h2><p>   <u>30</u>As he spoke these things, many believed in him. <u>31</u>Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples. <u>32</u>You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.*</h2><p>   <u>33</u>They answered him,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>We are Abraham’s offspring,* and have never been in bondage to anyone. How do you say, ‘You will be made free’?</h4><p>   <u>34</u>Jesus answered them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin. <u>35</u>A bondservant doesn’t live in the house forever. A son remains forever. <u>36</u>If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed. <u>37</u>I know that you are Abraham’s offspring,* yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. <u>38</u>I say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father.</h2><p>   <u>39</u>They answered him,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>Our father is Abraham.</h4><p>   Jesus said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham. <u>40</u>But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham didn’t do this. <u>41</u>You do the works of your father.</h2><p>   They said to him,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father, God.</h4><p>   <u>42</u>Therefore Jesus said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>If God were your father, you would love me, for I came out and have come from God. For I haven’t come of myself, but he sent me. <u>43</u>Why don’t you understand my speech? Because you can’t hear my word. <u>44</u>You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn’t stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and its father. <u>45</u>But because I tell the truth, you don’t believe me. <u>46</u>Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? <u>47</u>He who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you don’t hear, because you are not of God.</h2><p>   <u>48</u>Then the Jews answered him,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>Don’t we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?</h4><p>   <u>49</u>Jesus answered,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>I don’t have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. <u>50</u>But I don’t seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges. <u>51</u>Most certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death.</h2><p>   <u>52</u>Then the Jews said to him,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, ‘If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.’ <u>53</u>Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?</h4><p>   <u>54</u>Jesus answered,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God. <u>55</u>You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, ‘I don’t know him,’ I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word. <u>56</u>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad.</h2><p>   <u>57</u>The Jews therefore said to him,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?</h4><p>   <u>58</u>Jesus said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, I AM.*</h2><p>   <u>59</u>Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through the middle of them, and so passed by.</p><h5>*John 7:42 or, seed <br />*John 7:42 2 Samuel 7:12 <br />*John 7:42 Micah 5:2 <br />*John 7:52 See Isaiah 9:1 and Matthew 4:13-16. <br />*John 8:5 Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22 <br />*John 8:12 Isaiah 60:1 <br />*John 8:17 Deuteronomy 17:6; 19:15 <br />*John 8:24 or, I AM <br />*John 8:32 Psalm 119:45 <br />*John 8:33 or, seed <br />*John 8:37 or, seed <br />*John 8:58 or, I am</h5>\",\"path\":\"/344\",\"Question1\":\"List all the questions raised in the text.

How do you say, ‘You will be made free’?</h4><p>   <u>34</u>Jesus answered them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin. <u>35</u>A bondservant doesn’t live in the house forever. A son remains forever. <u>36</u>If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed. <u>37</u>I know that you are Abraham’s offspring,* yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. <u>38</u>I say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father.</h2><p>   <u>39</u>They answered him,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>Our father is Abraham.</h4><p>   Jesus said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham. <u>40</u>But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham didn’t do this. <u>41</u>You do the works of your father.</h2><p>   They said to him,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father, God.</h4><p>   <u>42</u>Therefore Jesus said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>If God were your father, you would love me, for I came out and have come from God. For I haven’t come of myself, but he sent me. <u>43</u>Why don’t you understand my speech? Because you can’t hear my word. <u>44</u>You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn’t stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and its father. <u>45</u>But because I tell the truth, you don’t believe me. <u>46</u>Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? <u>47</u>He who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you don’t hear, because you are not of God.</h2><p>   <u>48</u>Then the Jews answered him,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>Don’t we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?</h4><p>   <u>49</u>Jesus answered,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>I don’t have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. <u>50</u>But I don’t seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges. <u>51</u>Most certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death.</h2><p>   <u>52</u>Then the Jews said to him,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, ‘If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.’ <u>53</u>Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?</h4><p>   <u>54</u>Jesus answered,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God. <u>55</u>You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, ‘I don’t know him,’ I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word. <u>56</u>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad.</h2><p>   <u>57</u>The Jews therefore said to him,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?</h4><p>   <u>58</u>Jesus said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, I AM.*</h2><p>   <u>59</u>Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through the middle of them, and so passed by.</p><h5>*John 7:42 or, seed <br />*John 7:42 2 Samuel 7:12 <br />*John 7:42 Micah 5:2 <br />*John 7:52 See Isaiah 9:1 and Matthew 4:13-16. <br />*John 8:5 Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22 <br />*John 8:12 Isaiah 60:1 <br />*John 8:17 Deuteronomy 17:6; 19:15 <br />*John 8:24 or, I AM <br />*John 8:32 Psalm 119:45 <br />*John 8:33 or, seed <br />*John 8:37 or, seed <br />*John 8:58 or, I am</h5>\",\"path\":\"/344\",\"Question1\":\"List all the questions raised in the text.
