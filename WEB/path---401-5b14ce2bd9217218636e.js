For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, <u>14</u>not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. <u>15</u>To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. <u>16</u>They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.<br />   <strong>2</strong><u>2</u>But say the things which fit sound doctrine, <u>2</u>that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience: <u>3</u>and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good; <u>4</u>that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, <u>5</u>to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed. <u>6</u>Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded; <u>7</u>in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, <u>8</u>and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us. <u>9</u>Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting; <u>10</u>not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things. <u>11</u>For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, <u>12</u>instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world; <u>13</u>looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ; <u>14</u>who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works. <u>15</u>Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.<br />   <strong>3</strong><u>2</u>Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, <u>2</u>to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men. <u>3</u>For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. <u>4</u>But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared, <u>5</u>not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, <u>6</u>whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior; <u>7</u>that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. <u>8</u>This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men; <u>9</u>but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. <u>10</u>Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning; <u>11</u>knowing that such a one is perverted and sins, being self-condemned.<br />   <u>12</u>When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there. <u>13</u>Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them. <u>14</u>Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.<br />   <u>15</u>All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all.
