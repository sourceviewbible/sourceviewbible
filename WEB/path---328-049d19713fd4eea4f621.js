He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat. <u>4</u>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.</h2><p>   <u>5</u>Simon answered him,</p><h1>SIMON PETER</h1><h3>Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.</h3><p><u>6</u>When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking. <u>7</u>They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink. <u>8</u>But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying,</p><h1>SIMON PETER</h1><h3>Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.</h3><p><u>9</u>For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught; <u>10</u>and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.<br />   Jesus said to Simon,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Don’t be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive.</h2><p>   <u>11</u>When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him. <u>12</u>While he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying,</p><h1>A LEPER</h1><h4>Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.</h4><p>   <u>13</u>He stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>I want to. Be made clean.</h2><p>   Immediately the leprosy left him. <u>14</u>He commanded him to tell no one,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</h2><p><u>15</u>But the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. <u>16</u>But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed.<br />   <u>17</u>On one of those days, he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them. <u>18</u>Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus. <u>19</u>Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the middle before Jesus. <u>20</u>Seeing their faith, he said to him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Man, your sins are forgiven you.</h2><p>   <u>21</u>The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying,</p><h1>THE PHARISEES &amp; THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS</h1><h4>Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</h4><p>   <u>22</u>But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Why are you reasoning so in your hearts? <u>23</u>Which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you;’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk?’ <u>24</u>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins</h2><p>(he said to the paralyzed man),</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house.</h2><p>   <u>25</u>Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God. <u>26</u>Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying,</p><h1>PEOPLE IN CAPERNAUM</h1><h4>We have seen strange things today.</h4><p>   <u>27</u>After these things he went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Follow me!</h2><p>   <u>28</u>He left everything, and rose up and followed him. <u>29</u>Levi made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them. <u>30</u>Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying,</p><h1>THE PHARISEES &amp; THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS</h1><h4>Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?</h4><p><u>31</u>Jesus answered them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do. <u>32</u>I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</h2><p>   <u>33</u>They said to him,</p><h1>THE PHARISEES &amp; THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS</h1><h4>Why do John’s disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?</h4><p>   <u>34</u>He said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them? <u>35</u>But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days.</h2><p><u>36</u>He also told a parable to them.</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old. <u>37</u>No one puts new wine into old wine skins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed. <u>38</u>But new wine must be put into fresh wine skins, and both are preserved. <u>39</u>No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’</h2><p>   <strong>6</strong><u>1</u>Now on the second Sabbath after the first, he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands. <u>2</u>But some of the Pharisees said to them,</p><h1>THE PHARISEES</h1><h4>Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?</h4><p>   <u>3</u>Jesus, answering them, said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Haven’t you read what David did when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him; <u>4</u>how he entered into God’s house, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?</h2><p><u>5</u>He said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.</h2><p>   <u>6</u>It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered. <u>7</u>The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him. <u>8</u>But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Rise up, and stand in the middle.</h2><p>He arose and stood. <u>9</u>Then Jesus said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?</h2><p><u>10</u>He looked around at them all, and said to the man,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Stretch out your hand.</h2><p>He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other. <u>11</u>But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.<br />   <u>12</u>In these days, he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God. <u>13</u>When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles: <u>14</u>Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew; <u>15</u>Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Simon, who was called the Zealot; <u>16</u>Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor. <u>17</u>He came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; <u>18</u>as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed. <u>19</u>All the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out of him and healed them all.<br />   <u>20</u>He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2><p>   Blessed are you who are poor,<br />   God’s Kingdom is yours.<br />   <u>21</u>Blessed are you who hunger now,<br />   for you will be filled.<br />   Blessed are you who weep now,<br />   for you will laugh.<br />   <u>22</u>Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake.<br />   Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets.<br />   <u>24</u>But woe to you who are rich!<br />   For you have received your consolation.<br />   <u>25</u>Woe to you, you who are full now,<br />   for you will be hungry.<br />   Woe to you who laugh now,<br />   for you will mourn and weep.<br />   <u>26</u>Woe,* when* men speak well of you,<br />   for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets.<br />   <u>27</u>But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, <u>28</u>bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you. <u>29</u>To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don’t withhold your coat also. <u>30</u>Give to everyone who asks you, and don’t ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.<br />   <u>31</u>As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them. <u>32</u>If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. <u>33</u>If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. <u>34</u>If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much. <u>35</u>But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.<br />   <u>36</u>Therefore be merciful,<br />   even as your Father is also merciful.<br />   <u>37</u>Don’t judge,<br />   and you won’t be judged.<br />   Don’t condemn,<br />   and you won’t be condemned.<br />   Set free,<br />   and you will be set free.<br />   <u>38</u>Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you.* For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you.</h2><p>   <u>39</u>He spoke a parable to them.</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Can the blind guide the blind? Won’t they both fall into a pit? <u>40</u>A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher. <u>41</u>Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam that is in your own eye? <u>42</u>Or how can you tell your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,’ when you yourself don’t see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother’s eye. <u>43</u>For there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit; nor again a rotten tree that produces good fruit. <u>44</u>For each tree is known by its own fruit. For people don’t gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush. <u>45</u>The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks.<br />   <u>46</u>Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and don’t do the things which I say? <u>47</u>Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you who he is like. <u>48</u>He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock. <u>49</u>But he who hears, and doesn’t do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.</h2><h5>*Luke 6:26 TR adds “to you”<br />*Luke 6:26 TR adds “all”<br />*Luke 6:38 literally, into your bosom.</h5>",path:"/328",Question1:"What God-given instructions do you note in this portion of Scripture?",Question2:"Put yourself in the original setting and creatively think about what it might have been like to receive this instruction.
