Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward, <u>61</u>and said,</p><h1>SOME FALSE WITNESSES</h1><h4>This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.’</h4><p>   <u>62</u>The high priest stood up, and said to him,</p><h1>CAIAPHAS THE HIGH PRIEST</h1><h4>Have you no answer?

You see to it.</h4><p>   <u>5</u>He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself.<p>   <u>6</u>The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said,</p><h1>JEWISH LEADERS</h1><h4>It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.</h4><p><u>7</u>They took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them, to bury strangers in. <u>8</u>Therefore that field was called “The Field of Blood” to this day. <u>9</u>Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah* the prophet was fulfilled, saying,<br />   “They took the thirty pieces of silver,<br />   the price of him upon whom a price had been set,<br />   whom some of the children of Israel priced,<br />   <u>10</u>and they gave them for the potter’s field,<br />   as the Lord commanded me.”*<br />   <u>11</u>Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE</h1><h4>Are you the King of the Jews?</h4><p>   Jesus said to him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>So you say.</h2><p>   <u>12</u>When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. <u>13</u>Then Pilate said to him,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE</h1><h4>Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?</h4><p>   <u>14</u>He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.<p>   <u>15</u>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired. <u>16</u>They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. <u>17</u>When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE</h1><h4>Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?</h4><p><u>18</u>For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.<br />   <u>19</u>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE’S WIFE</h1><h4>Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.</h4><p>   <u>20</u>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. <u>21</u>But the governor answered them,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE</h1><h4>Which of the two do you want me to release to you?</h4><p>   They said,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>Barabbas!</h4><p>   <u>22</u>Pilate said to them,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE</h1><h4>What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?</h4><p>   They all said to him,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>Let him be crucified!</h4><p>   <u>23</u>But the governor said,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE</h1><h4>Why? What evil has he done?</h4><p>   But they cried out exceedingly, saying,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>Let him be crucified!</h4><p>   <u>24</u>So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE</h1><h4>I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.</h4><p>   <u>25</u>All the people answered,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>May his blood be on us, and on our children!</h4><p>   <u>26</u>Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.</p><h5>*Matthew 26:26 TR reads “blessed” instead of “gave thanks for”<br />*Matthew 26:31 Zechariah 13:7<br />*Matthew 27:9 some manuscripts omit “Jeremiah”<br />*Matthew 27:10 Zechariah 11:12-13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9</h5>\",\"path\":\"/314\",\"Question1\":\"In this story is there an example that you should imitate?

He went away and hanged himself.<p>   <u>6</u>The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said,</p><h1>JEWISH LEADERS</h1><h4>It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.</h4><p><u>7</u>They took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them, to bury strangers in. <u>8</u>Therefore that field was called “The Field of Blood” to this day. <u>9</u>Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah* the prophet was fulfilled, saying,<br />   “They took the thirty pieces of silver,<br />   the price of him upon whom a price had been set,<br />   whom some of the children of Israel priced,<br />   <u>10</u>and they gave them for the potter’s field,<br />   as the Lord commanded me.”*<br />   <u>11</u>Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE</h1><h4>Are you the King of the Jews?</h4><p>   Jesus said to him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>So you say.</h2><p>   <u>12</u>When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. <u>13</u>Then Pilate said to him,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE</h1><h4>Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?</h4><p>   <u>14</u>He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.<p>   <u>15</u>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired. <u>16</u>They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. <u>17</u>When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE</h1><h4>Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?</h4><p><u>18</u>For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.<br />   <u>19</u>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE’S WIFE</h1><h4>Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.</h4><p>   <u>20</u>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. <u>21</u>But the governor answered them,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE</h1><h4>Which of the two do you want me to release to you?</h4><p>   They said,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>Barabbas!</h4><p>   <u>22</u>Pilate said to them,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE</h1><h4>What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?</h4><p>   They all said to him,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>Let him be crucified!</h4><p>   <u>23</u>But the governor said,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE</h1><h4>Why? What evil has he done?</h4><p>   But they cried out exceedingly, saying,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>Let him be crucified!</h4><p>   <u>24</u>So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying,</p><h1>PONTIUS PILATE</h1><h4>I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.</h4><p>   <u>25</u>All the people answered,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>May his blood be on us, and on our children!</h4><p>   <u>26</u>Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.</p><h5>*Matthew 26:26 TR reads “blessed” instead of “gave thanks for”<br />*Matthew 26:31 Zechariah 13:7<br />*Matthew 27:9 some manuscripts omit “Jeremiah”<br />*Matthew 27:10 Zechariah 11:12-13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9</h5>\",\"path\":\"/314\",\"Question1\":\"In this story is there an example that you should imitate?
