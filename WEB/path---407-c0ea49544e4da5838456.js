We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, <u>2</u>a servant of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man. <u>3</u>For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer. <u>4</u>For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law; <u>5</u>who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, “See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.”* <u>6</u>But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as law. <u>7</u>For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second. <u>8</u>For finding fault with them, he said,<br />   Behold,* the days come”, says the Lord,<br />   that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;<br />   <u>9</u>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers,<br />   in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;<br />   for they didn’t continue in my covenant,<br />   and I disregarded them,” says the Lord.<br />   <u>10</u>For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel.<br />   After those days,” says the Lord;<br />   I will put my laws into their mind,<br />   I will also write them on their heart.<br />   I will be their God,<br />   and they will be my people.<br />   <u>11</u>They will not teach every man his fellow citizen,*<br />   and every man his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’<br />   for all will know me,<br />   from their least to their greatest.<br />   <u>12</u>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness.<br />   I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more.”*<br />   <u>13</u>In that he says, “A new covenant”, he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away.<br />   <strong>9</strong><u>1</u>Now indeed even the first* covenant had ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary. <u>2</u>For a tabernacle was prepared. In the first part were the lamp stand, the table, and the show bread; which is called the Holy Place. <u>3</u>After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies, <u>4</u>having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant; <u>5</u>and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we can’t speak now in detail. <u>6</u>Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services, <u>7</u>but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the people. <u>8</u>The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the Holy Place wasn’t yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing; <u>9</u>which is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the worshiper perfect; <u>10</u>being only (with meats and drinks and various washings) fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.<br />   <u>11</u>But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation, <u>12</u>nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption. <u>13</u>For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh: <u>14</u>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without defect to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? <u>15</u>For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. <u>16</u>For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him who made it. <u>17</u>For a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives. <u>18</u>Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood. <u>19</u>For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, <u>20</u>saying, “This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.”*<br />   <u>21</u>Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in the same way with the blood. <u>22</u>According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission. <u>23</u>It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <u>24</u>For Christ hasn’t entered into holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us; <u>25</u>nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own, <u>26</u>or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. <u>27</u>Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment, <u>28</u>so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation.<br />   <strong>10</strong><u>1</u>For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near. <u>2</u>Or else wouldn’t they have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins? <u>3</u>But in those sacrifices there is a yearly reminder of sins. <u>4</u>For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. <u>5</u>Therefore when he comes into the world, he says,<br />   Sacrifice and offering you didn’t desire,<br />   but you prepared a body for me.<br />   <u>6</u>You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.<br />   <u>7</u>Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me)<br />   to do your will, O God.’”*<br />   <u>8</u>Previously saying, “Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn’t desire, neither had pleasure in them” (those which are offered according to the law), <u>9</u>then he has said, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He takes away the first, that he may establish the second, <u>10</u>by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. <u>11</u>Every priest indeed stands day by day serving and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins, <u>12</u>but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God; <u>13</u>from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet. <u>14</u>For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified. <u>15</u>The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,<br />   <u>16</u>This is the covenant that I will make with them:<br />   ‘After those days,’ says the Lord,<br />   ‘I will put my laws on their heart,<br />   I will also write them on their mind;’”*<br />   then he says,<br />   <u>17</u>I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more.”*<br />   <u>18</u>Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</p><h5>*Hebrews 8:5 Exodus 25:40<br />*Hebrews 8:8 “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.
