But where are the nine? <u>18</u>Were there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?</h2><p><u>19</u>Then he said to him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you.</h2><p>   <u>20</u>Being asked by the Pharisees when God’s Kingdom would come, he answered them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>God’s Kingdom doesn’t come with observation; <u>21</u>neither will they say, ‘Look, here!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ for behold, God’s Kingdom is within you.</h2><p>   <u>22</u>He said to the disciples,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it. <u>23</u>They will tell you, ‘Look, here!’ or ‘Look, there!’ Don’t go away, nor follow after them, <u>24</u>for as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day. <u>25</u>But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. <u>26</u>As it was in the days of Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man. <u>27</u>They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. <u>28</u>Likewise, even as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built; <u>29</u>but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all. <u>30</u>It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed. <u>31</u>In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back. <u>32</u>Remember Lot’s wife! <u>33</u>Whoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it. <u>34</u>I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left. <u>35</u>There will be two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left. <u>36</u>*</h2><p>   <u>37</u>They, answering, asked him,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>Where, Lord?</h3><p>   He said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Where the body is, there will the vultures also be gathered together.</h2><p>   <strong>18</strong><u>1</u>He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up, <u>2</u>saying,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>There was a judge in a certain city who didn’t fear God, and didn’t respect man. <u>3</u>A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, ‘Defend me from my adversary!’ <u>4</u>He wouldn’t for a while, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God, nor respect man, <u>5</u>yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.’</h2><p>   <u>6</u>The Lord said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Listen to what the unrighteous judge says. <u>7</u>Won’t God avenge his chosen ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them? <u>8</u>I tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?</h2><p>   <u>9</u>He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others.</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2><u>10</u>Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector. <u>11</u>The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: ‘God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of men, extortionists, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. <u>12</u>I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.’ <u>13</u>But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn’t even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ <u>14</u>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.</h2><p>   <u>15</u>They were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. <u>16</u>Jesus summoned them, saying,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Allow the little children to come to me, and don’t hinder them, for God’s Kingdom belongs to such as these. <u>17</u>Most certainly, I tell you, whoever doesn’t receive God’s Kingdom like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.</h2><p>   <u>18</u>A certain ruler asked him, saying,</p><h1>A RICH YOUNG MAN</h1><h4>Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</h4><p>   <u>19</u>Jesus asked him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one—God. <u>20</u>You know the commandments: ‘Don’t commit adultery,’ ‘Don’t murder,’ ‘Don’t steal,’ ‘Don’t give false testimony,’ ‘Honor your father and your mother.’*</h2><p>   <u>21</u>He said,</p><h1>A RICH YOUNG MAN</h1><h4>I have observed all these things from my youth up.</h4><p>   <u>22</u>When Jesus heard these things, he said to him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me.</h2><p>   <u>23</u>But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.<br />   <u>24</u>Jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom! <u>25</u>For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.</h2><p>   <u>26</u>Those who heard it said,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>Then who can be saved?</h4><p>   <u>27</u>But he said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</h2><p>   <u>28</u>Peter said,</p><h1>SIMON PETER</h1><h3>Look, we have left everything, and followed you.</h3><p>   <u>29</u>He said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for God’s Kingdom’s sake, <u>30</u>who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life.</h2><p>   <u>31</u>He took the twelve aside, and said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed. <u>32</u>For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on. <u>33</u>They will scourge and kill him. On the third day, he will rise again.</h2><p>   <u>34</u>They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn’t understand the things that were said. <u>35</u>As he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging. <u>36</u>Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant. <u>37</u>They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. <u>38</u>He cried out,</p><h1>BLIND BARTIMEAUS</h1><h4>Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!</h4><p><u>39</u>Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more,</p><h1>BLIND BARTIMEAUS</h1><h4>You son of David, have mercy on me!</h4><p>   <u>40</u>Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2><u>41</u>What do you want me to do?</h2><p>   He said,</p><h1>BLIND BARTIMEAUS</h1><h4>Lord, that I may see again.</h4><p>   <u>42</u>Jesus said to him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.</h2><p>   <u>43</u>Immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God.<br />   <strong>19</strong><u>1</u>He entered and was passing through Jericho. <u>2</u>There was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. <u>3</u>He was trying to see who Jesus was, and couldn’t because of the crowd, because he was short. <u>4</u>He ran on ahead, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was going to pass that way. <u>5</u>When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.</h2><p><u>6</u>He hurried, came down, and received him joyfully. <u>7</u>When they saw it, they all murmured, saying,</p><h1>THE CROWD</h1><h4>He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner.</h4><p>   <u>8</u>Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord,</p><h1>ZACCHAEUS</h1><h4>Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as much.</h4><p>   <u>9</u>Jesus said to him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Today, salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham. <u>10</u>For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.</h2><p>   <u>11</u>As they heard these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that God’s Kingdom would be revealed immediately. <u>12</u>He said therefore,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. <u>13</u>He called ten servants of his, and gave them ten mina coins,* and told them, ‘Conduct business until I come.’ <u>14</u>But his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him, saying, ‘We don’t want this man to reign over us.’<br />   <u>15</u>When he had come back again, having received the kingdom, he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by conducting business. <u>16</u>The first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.’<br />   <u>17</u>He said to him, ‘Well done, you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.’<br />   <u>18</u>The second came, saying, ‘Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.’<br />   <u>19</u>So he said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’ <u>20</u>Another came, saying, ‘Lord, behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief, <u>21</u>for I feared you, because you are an exacting man. You take up that which you didn’t lay down, and reap that which you didn’t sow.’<br />   <u>22</u>He said to him, ‘Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting man, taking up that which I didn’t lay down, and reaping that which I didn’t sow. <u>23</u>Then why didn’t you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?’ <u>24</u>He said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas.’<br />   <u>25</u>They said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten minas!’ <u>26</u>‘For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him. <u>27</u>But bring those enemies of mine who didn’t want me to reign over them here, and kill them before me.’</h2><h5>*Luke 17:36 Some Greek manuscripts add: “Two will be in the field: the one taken, and the other left.”<br />*Luke 18:20 Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20<br />*Luke 19:13 10 minas was more than 3 years’ wages for an agricultural laborer.</h5>",path:"/335",Question1:"What God-given instructions do you note in this portion of Scripture?",Question2:"Put yourself in the original setting and creatively think about what it might have been like to receive this instruction.
