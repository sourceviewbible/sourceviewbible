Simon’s mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her. <u>39</u>He stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them. <u>40</u>When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. <u>41</u>Demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying,</p><h1>SOME DEMONS</h1><h4>You are the Christ, the Son of God!</h4><p>Rebuking them, he didn’t allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.<br />   <u>42</u>When it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn’t go away from them. <u>43</u>But he said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>I must preach the good news of God’s Kingdom to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent.</h2><p><u>44</u>He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.</p><h5>*Luke 3:6 Isaiah 40:3-5<br />*Luke 3:19 a tetrarch is one of four governors of a province<br />*Luke 3:19 TR reads “brother Philip’s” instead of “brother’s”<br />*Luke 3:33 NU reads “Admin, the son of Arni” instead of “Aram”<br />*Luke 4:4 Deuteronomy 8:3<br />*Luke 4:8 Deuteronomy 6:13<br />*Luke 4:11 Psalm 91:11-12<br />*Luke 4:12 Deuteronomy 6:16<br />*Luke 4:18 NU omits “to heal the broken hearted”<br />*Luke 4:19 Isaiah 61:1-2</h5>\",\"path\":\"/327\",\"Question1\":\"Consider the acts of God described in this passage.\",\"Question2\":\"What do these illustrate about the ways of God?\",\"Question3\":\"Have you experienced these ways of God in your life?
