A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him. <u>9</u>He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn’t press on him. <u>10</u>For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him. <u>11</u>The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried,</p><h1>SOME DEMONS</h1><h4>You are the Son of God!</h4><p><u>12</u>He sternly warned them that they should not make him known. <br />   <u>13</u>He went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him. <u>14</u>He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach, <u>15</u>and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons: <u>16</u>Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter; <u>17</u>James the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James, and he called them Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder; <u>18</u>Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot; <u>19</u>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. <br />   Then he came into a house. <u>20</u>The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. <u>21</u>When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him: for they said,</p><h1>JESUS’ FAMILY</h1><h4>He is insane.</h4><p><u>22</u>The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said,</p><h1>JEWISH LEADERS</h1><h4>He has Beelzebul,</h4><p>and,</p><h1>JEWISH LEADERS</h1><h4>By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.</h4><p>   <u>23</u>He summoned them, and said to them in parables,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>How can Satan cast out Satan? <u>24</u>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. <u>25</u>If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. <u>26</u>If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can’t stand, but has an end. <u>27</u>But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.<p>   <u>28</u>Most certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme; <u>29</u>but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation.*</h2><p><u>30</u>—because they said,</p><h1>JEWISH LEADERS</h1><h4>He has an unclean spirit.</h4><p>   <u>31</u>His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him. <u>32</u>A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him,</p><h1>SOMEONE IN CAPERNAUM</h1><h4>Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters* are outside looking for you.</h4><p>   <u>33</u>He answered them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Who are my mother and my brothers?</h2><p><u>34</u>Looking around at those who sat around him, he said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Behold, my mother and my brothers! <u>35</u>For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</h2><p>   <strong>4</strong><u>1</u>Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea. <u>2</u>He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2><u>3</u>Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow, <u>4</u>and as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds* came and devoured it. <u>5</u>Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil. <u>6</u>When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. <u>7</u>Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. <u>8</u>Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some produced thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much.</h2><p><u>9</u>He said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.</h2><p>   <u>10</u>When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables. <u>11</u>He said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>To you is given the mystery of God’s Kingdom, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables, <u>12</u>that ‘seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.’*</h2><p>   <u>13</u>He said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Don’t you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables? <u>14</u>The farmer sows the word. <u>15</u>The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them. <u>16</u>These in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy. <u>17</u>They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble. <u>18</u>Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word, <u>19</u>and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. <u>20</u>Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.</h2><p>   <u>21</u>He said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket* or under a bed? Isn’t it put on a stand? <u>22</u>For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light. <u>23</u>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.</h2><p>   <u>24</u>He said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear. <u>25</u>For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.</h2><p>   <u>26</u>He said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>God’s Kingdom is as if a man should cast seed on the earth, <u>27</u>and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn’t know how. <u>28</u>For the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. <u>29</u>But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.</h2><p>   <u>30</u>He said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>How will we liken God’s Kingdom? Or with what parable will we illustrate it? <u>31</u>It’s like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth, <u>32</u>yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.</h2><p>   <u>33</u>With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it. <u>34</u>Without a parable he didn’t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything. <br />   <u>35</u>On that day, when evening had come, he said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Let’s go over to the other side.</h2><p><u>36</u>Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him. <u>37</u>A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled. <u>38</u>He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>Teacher, don’t you care that we are dying?</h3><p>   <u>39</u>He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Peace! Be still!</h2><p>The wind ceased, and there was a great calm. <u>40</u>He said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?</h2><p>   <u>41</u>They were greatly afraid, and said to one another,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</h3><p>   <strong>5</strong><u>1</u>They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. <u>2</u>When he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs. <u>3</u>He lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains, <u>4</u>because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him. <u>5</u>Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones. <u>6</u>When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him, <u>7</u>and crying out with a loud voice, he said,</p><h1>MAN POSSESSED BY LEGION</h1><h4>What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don’t torment me.</h4><p><u>8</u>For he said to him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!</h2><p>   <u>9</u>He asked him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>What is your name?</h2><p>   He said to him,</p><h1>MAN POSSESSED BY LEGION</h1><h4>My name is Legion, for we are many.</h4><p><u>10</u>He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country. <u>11</u>Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding. <u>12</u>All the demons begged him, saying,</p><h1>MAN POSSESSED BY LEGION</h1><h4>Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.</h4><p>   <u>13</u>At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea. <u>14</u>Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country. <br />   The people came to see what it was that had happened. <u>15</u>They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid. <u>16</u>Those who saw it declared to them what happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs. <u>17</u>They began to beg him to depart from their region. <br />   <u>18</u>As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him. <u>19</u>He didn’t allow him, but said to him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you.</h2><p>   <u>20</u>He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled. <br />   <u>21</u>When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea. <u>22</u>Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet, <u>23</u>and begged him much, saying,</p><h1>JAIRUS</h1><h4>My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.</h4><p>   <u>24</u>He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides. <u>25</u>A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years, <u>26</u>and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse, <u>27</u>having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes. <u>28</u>For she said,</p><h1>A HEMORRHAGING WOMAN</h1><h4>If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.</h4><p><u>29</u>Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction. <br />   <u>30</u>Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Who touched my clothes?</h2><p>   <u>31</u>His disciples said to him,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’</h3><p>   <u>32</u>He looked around to see her who had done this thing. <u>33</u>But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. <br />   <u>34</u>He said to her,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.</h2><p>   <u>35</u>While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying,</p><h1>JAIRUS’ MESSENGERS</h1><h4>Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?</h4><p>   <u>36</u>But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Don’t be afraid, only believe.</h2><p><u>37</u>He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. <u>38</u>He came to the synagogue ruler’s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing. <u>39</u>When he had entered in, he said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep.</h2><p>   <u>40</u>They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying. <u>41</u>Taking the child by the hand, he said to her,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Talitha cumi!</h2><p>which means, being interpreted, “Girl, I tell you, get up!” <u>42</u>Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement. <u>43</u>He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.</p><h5>*Mark 3:29 NU reads, guilty of an eternal sin. <br />*Mark 3:32 TR omits “your sisters” <br />*Mark 4:4 TR adds “of the air” <br />*Mark 4:12 Isaiah 6:9-10 <br />*Mark 4:21 literally, a modion, a dry measuring basket containing about a peck (about 9 liters) </h5>",path:"/318",Question1:"With which character do you most identify in this story?
