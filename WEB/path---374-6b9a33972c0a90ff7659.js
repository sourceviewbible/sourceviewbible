Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. <u>2</u>But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn’t yet know as he ought to know. <u>3</u>But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him. <u>4</u>Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one. <u>5</u>For though there are things that are called “gods”, whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many “gods” and many “lords”; <u>6</u>yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him. <u>7</u>However, that knowledge isn’t in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. <u>8</u>But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don’t eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better. <u>9</u>But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak. <u>10</u>For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol’s temple, won’t his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? <u>11</u>And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died. <u>12</u>Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. <u>13</u>Therefore if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forever more, that I don’t cause my brother to stumble.<br />   <strong>9</strong><u>1</u>Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Haven’t I seen Jesus Christ, our Lord? Aren’t you my work in the Lord? <u>2</u>If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. <u>3</u>My defense to those who examine me is this. <u>4</u>Have we no right to eat and to drink? <u>5</u>Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas? <u>6</u>Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work? <u>7</u>What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and doesn’t eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, and doesn’t drink from the flock’s milk? <u>8</u>Do I speak these things according to the ways of men? Or doesn’t the law also say the same thing? <u>9</u>For it is written in the law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.”* Is it for the oxen that God cares, <u>10</u>or does he say it assuredly for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope. <u>11</u>If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things? <u>12</u>If others partake of this right over you, don’t we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ. <u>13</u>Don’t you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar? <u>14</u>Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News. <u>15</u>But I have used none of these things, and I don’t write these things that it may be done so in my case; for I would rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting void. <u>16</u>For if I preach the Good News, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me, if I don’t preach the Good News. <u>17</u>For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me. <u>18</u>What then is my reward? That, when I preach the Good News, I may present the Good News of Christ without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News. <u>19</u>For though I was free from all, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more. <u>20</u>To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law; <u>21</u>to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law. <u>22</u>To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some. <u>23</u>Now I do this for the sake of the Good News, that I may be a joint partaker of it. <u>24</u>Don’t you know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run like that, that you may win. <u>25</u>Every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible. <u>26</u>I therefore run like that, as not uncertainly. I fight like that, as not beating the air, <u>27</u>but I beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.<br />   <strong>10</strong><u>1</u>Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; <u>2</u>and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; <u>3</u>and all ate the same spiritual food; <u>4</u>and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ. <u>5</u>However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness. <u>6</u>Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. <u>7</u>Don’t be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.”* <u>8</u>Let us not commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell. <u>9</u>Let us not test Christ,* as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents. <u>10</u>Don’t grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer. <u>11</u>Now all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come. <u>12</u>Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesn’t fall.<br />   <u>13</u>No temptation has taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. <u>14</u>Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. <u>15</u>I speak as to wise men. Judge what I say. <u>16</u>The cup of blessing which we bless, isn’t it a sharing of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, isn’t it a sharing of the body of Christ? <u>17</u>Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread. <u>18</u>Consider Israel according to the flesh. Don’t those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?<br />   <u>19</u>What am I saying then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? <u>20</u>But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I don’t desire that you would have fellowship with demons. <u>21</u>You can’t both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can’t both partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons. <u>22</u>Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? <u>23</u>“All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are profitable. “All things are lawful for me,” but not all things build up. <u>24</u>Let no one seek his own, but each one his neighbor’s good. <u>25</u>Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience, <u>26</u>for “the earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness.”* <u>27</u>But if one of those who don’t believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience. <u>28</u>But if anyone says to you, “This was offered to idols,” don’t eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience. For “the earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness.” <u>29</u>Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other’s conscience. For why is my liberty judged by another conscience? <u>30</u>If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks? <u>31</u>Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. <u>32</u>Give no occasions for stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the assembly of God; <u>33</u>even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.<br />   <strong>11</strong><u>1</u>Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.</p><h5>*1 Corinthians 9:9 Deuteronomy 25:4<br />*1 Corinthians 10:7 Exodus 32:6<br />*1 Corinthians 10:9 NU reads “the Lord” instead of “Christ”.<br />*1 Corinthians 10:26 Psalm 24:1</h5>",path:"/374",Question1:"With which character do you most identify in this portion of Scripture?
