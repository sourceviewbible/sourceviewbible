Isn’t his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, Joses, Simon, and Judas?* <u>56</u>Aren’t all of his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all of these things?</h4><p><u>57</u>They were offended by him.<br />   But Jesus said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.</h2><p><u>58</u>He didn’t do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.<br />   <strong>14</strong><u>1</u>At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus, <u>2</u>and said to his servants,</p><h1>HEROD ANTIPAS</h1><h4>This is John the Baptizer. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him.</h4><p><u>3</u>For Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife. <u>4</u>For John said to him,</p><h1>JOHN THE BAPTIST</h1><h4>It is not lawful for you to have her.</h4><p><u>5</u>When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. <u>6</u>But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod. <u>7</u>Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask. <u>8</u>She, being prompted by her mother, said,</p><h1>HERODIAS THE YOUNGER</h1><h4>Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer.</h4><p>   <u>9</u>The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given, <u>10</u>and he sent and beheaded John in the prison. <u>11</u>His head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady: and she brought it to her mother. <u>12</u>His disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and they went and told Jesus. <u>13</u>Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.<br />   <u>14</u>Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them, and healed their sick. <u>15</u>When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.</h3><p>   <u>16</u>But Jesus said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.</h2><p>   <u>17</u>They told him,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>We only have here five loaves and two fish.</h3><p>   <u>18</u>He said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Bring them here to me.</h2><p><u>19</u>He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes. <u>20</u>They all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces. <u>21</u>Those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.<br />   <u>22</u>Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. <u>23</u>After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone. <u>24</u>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary. <u>25</u>In the fourth watch of the night,* Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.* <u>26</u>When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>It’s a ghost!</h3><p>and they cried out for fear. <u>27</u>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Cheer up! It is I!* Don’t be afraid.</h2><p>   <u>28</u>Peter answered him and said,</p><h1>SIMON PETER</h1><h3>Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters.</h3><p>   <u>29</u>He said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Come!</h2><p>   Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to Jesus. <u>30</u>But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying,</p><h1>SIMON PETER</h1><h3>Lord, save me!</h3><p>   <u>31</u>Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>You of little faith, why did you doubt?</h2><p><u>32</u>When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased. <u>33</u>Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>You are truly the Son of God!</h3><p>   <u>34</u>When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret. <u>35</u>When the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to him all who were sick, <u>36</u>and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe* of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole.<br />   <strong>15</strong><u>1</u>Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,</p><h1>JEWISH LEADERS</h1><h4><u>2</u>Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.</h4><p>   <u>3</u>He answered them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition? <u>4</u>For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’* and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’* <u>5</u>But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,” <u>6</u>he shall not honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition. <u>7</u>You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,<br />   <u>8</u>‘These people draw near to me with their mouth,<br />   and honor me with their lips;<br />   but their heart is far from me.<br />   <u>9</u>And in vain do they worship me,<br />   teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’*</h2><p>   <u>10</u>He summoned the multitude, and said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Hear, and understand. <u>11</u>That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.</h2><p>   <u>12</u>Then the disciples came, and said to him,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?</h3><p>   <u>13</u>But he answered,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted. <u>14</u>Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.</h2><p>   <u>15</u>Peter answered him,</p><h1>SIMON PETER</h1><h3>Explain the parable to us.</h3><p>   <u>16</u>So Jesus said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Do you also still not understand? <u>17</u>Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body? <u>18</u>But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man. <u>19</u>For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies. <u>20</u>These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.</h2><p>   <u>21</u>Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon. <u>22</u>Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying,</p><h1>A SYRO-PHOENICIAN WOMAN</h1><h4>Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!</h4><p>   <u>23</u>But he answered her not a word.<br />   His disciples came and begged him, saying,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>Send her away; for she cries after us.</h3><p>   <u>24</u>But he answered,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</h2><p>   <u>25</u>But she came and worshiped him, saying,</p><h1>A SYRO-PHOENICIAN WOMAN</h1><h4>Lord, help me.</h4><p>   <u>26</u>But he answered,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.</h2><p>   <u>27</u>But she said,</p><h1>A SYRO-PHOENICIAN WOMAN</h1><h4>Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.</h4><p>   <u>28</u>Then Jesus answered her,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.</h2><p>And her daughter was healed from that hour.<br />   <u>29</u>Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there. <u>30</u>Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them, <u>31</u>so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, injured whole, lame walking, and blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel.<br />   <u>32</u>Jesus summoned his disciples and said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.</h2><p>   <u>33</u>The disciples said to him,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?</h3><p>   <u>34</u>Jesus said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>How many loaves do you have?</h2><p>   They said,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>Seven, and a few small fish.</h3><p>   <u>35</u>He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; <u>36</u>and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. <u>37</u>They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. <u>38</u>Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. <u>39</u>Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.<br />   <strong>16</strong><u>1</u>The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven. <u>2</u>But he answered them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’ <u>3</u>In the morning, ‘It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can’t discern the signs of the times! <u>4</u>An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</h2><p>   He left them, and departed. <u>5</u>The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread. <u>6</u>Jesus said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</h2><p>   <u>7</u>They reasoned among themselves, saying,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>We brought no bread.</h3><p>   <u>8</u>Jesus, perceiving it, said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, ‘because you have brought no bread?’ <u>9</u>Don’t you yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up? <u>10</u>Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? <u>11</u>How is it that you don’t perceive that I didn’t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</h2><p>   <u>12</u>Then they understood that he didn’t tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.<p>   <u>13</u>Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?</h2><p>   <u>14</u>They said,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.</h3><p>   <u>15</u>He said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>But who do you say that I am?</h2><p>   <u>16</u>Simon Peter answered,</p><h1>SIMON PETER</h1><h3>You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</h3><p>   <u>17</u>Jesus answered him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. <u>18</u>I also tell you that you are Peter,* and on this rock* I will build my assembly, and the gates of Hades* will not prevail against it. <u>19</u>I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.</h2><p><u>20</u>Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ.<p>   <u>21</u>From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.<br />   <u>22</u>Peter took him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying,</p><h1>SIMON PETER</h1><h3>Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you.</h3><p>   <u>23</u>But he turned, and said to Peter,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.</h2><p>   <u>24</u>Then Jesus said to his disciples,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. <u>25</u>For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it. <u>26</u>For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life? <u>27</u>For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds. <u>28</u>Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.</h2><p>   <strong>17</strong><u>1</u>After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves. <u>2</u>He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light. <u>3</u>Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.<br />   <u>4</u>Peter answered, and said to Jesus,</p><h1>SIMON PETER</h1><h3>Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let’s make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</h3><p>   <u>5</u>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.</h2><p>   <u>6</u>When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid. <u>7</u>Jesus came and touched them and said,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Get up, and don’t be afraid.</h2><p><u>8</u>Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.<p>   <u>9</u>As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Don’t tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.</h2><p>   <u>10</u>His disciples asked him, saying,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?</h3><p>   <u>11</u>Jesus answered them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things, <u>12</u>but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn’t recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them.</h2><p><u>13</u>Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer.<br />   <u>14</u>When they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, saying,</p><h1>AN EPILEPTIC’S FATHER</h1><h4><u>15</u>Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water. <u>16</u>So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.</h4><p>   <u>17</u>Jesus answered,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.</h2><p><u>18</u>Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.<br />   <u>19</u>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said,</p><h1>THE DISCIPLES</h1><h3>Why weren’t we able to cast it out?</h3><p>   <u>20</u>He said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. <u>21</u>But this kind doesn’t go out except by prayer and fasting.</h2><p>   <u>22</u>While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, <u>23</u>and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up.</h2><p>   They were exceedingly sorry.<p>   <u>24</u>When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins* came to Peter, and said,</p><h1>THE TAX COLLECTORS</h1><h4>Doesn’t your teacher pay the didrachma?</h4><p><u>25</u>He said,</p><h1>SIMON PETER</h1><h3>Yes.</h3><p>   When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?</h2><p>   <u>26</u>Peter said to him,</p><h1>SIMON PETER</h1><h3>From strangers.</h3><p>   Jesus said to him,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Therefore the children are exempt. <u>27</u>But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin.* Take that, and give it to them for me and you.</h2><h5>*Matthew 13:55 or, Judah<br />*Matthew 14:25 The night was equally divided into four watches, so the fourth watch is approximately 3:00 A.
