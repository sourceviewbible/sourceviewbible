They informed the governor against Paul. <u>2</u>When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying,</p><h1>TERTULLUS THE LAWYER</h1><h4>Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that excellent measures are coming to this nation, <u>3</u>we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness. <u>4</u>But, that I don’t delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words. <u>5</u>For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. <u>6</u>He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.* <u>7</u>* <u>8</u>*By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.</h4><p>   <u>9</u>The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so. <u>10</u>When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered,</p><h1>PAUL</h1><h3>Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense, <u>11</u>seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem. <u>12</u>In the temple they didn’t find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city. <u>13</u>Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me. <u>14</u>But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets; <u>15</u>having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. <u>16</u>Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men. <u>17</u>Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings; <u>18</u>amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil. <u>19</u>They ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me. <u>20</u>Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council, <u>21</u>unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them, ‘Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!’</h3><p>   <u>22</u>But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying,</p><h1>GOVERNOR FELIX</h1><h4>When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case.</h4><p><u>23</u>He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him. <u>24</u>But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus. <u>25</u>As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered,</p><h1>GOVERNOR FELIX</h1><h4>Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you.</h4><p><u>26</u>Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore also he sent for him more often, and talked with him. <u>27</u>But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.<br />   <strong>25</strong><u>1</u>Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. <u>2</u>Then the high priest and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul, and they begged him, <u>3</u>asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem; plotting to kill him on the way. <u>4</u>However Festus answered that Paul should be kept in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart shortly.</p><h1>GOVERNOR PORCIUS FESTUS</h1><h4><u>5</u>Let them therefore, </h4><p>said he,</p><h1>GOVERNOR PORCIUS FESTUS</h1><h4>that are in power among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him.</h4><p>   <u>6</u>When he had stayed among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat, and commanded Paul to be brought. <u>7</u>When he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove, <u>8</u>while he said in his defense,</p><h1>PAUL</h1><h3>Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all.</h3><p>   <u>9</u>But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said,</p><h1>GOVERNOR PORCIUS FESTUS</h1><h4>Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be judged by me there concerning these things?</h4><p>   <u>10</u>But Paul said,</p><h1>PAUL</h1><h3>I am standing before Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well. <u>11</u>For if I have done wrong, and have committed anything worthy of death, I don’t refuse to die; but if none of those things is true that they accuse me of, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!</h3><p>   <u>12</u>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,</p><h1>GOVERNOR PORCIUS FESTUS</h1><h4>You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you shall go.</h4><p>   <u>13</u>Now when some days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and greeted Festus. <u>14</u>As he stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying,</p><h1>GOVERNOR PORCIUS FESTUS</h1><h4>There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix; <u>15</u>about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for a sentence against him. <u>16</u>To whom I answered that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction, before the accused has met the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him. <u>17</u>When therefore they had come together here, I didn’t delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought. <u>18</u>Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed; <u>19</u>but had certain questions against him about their own religion, and about one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. <u>20</u>Being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters. <u>21</u>But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar.</h4><p>   <u>22</u>Agrippa said to Festus,</p><h1>HEROD AGRIPPA</h1><h4>I also would like to hear the man myself.</h4><h1>GOVERNOR PORCIUS FESTUS</h1><h4> Tomorrow,</h4><p>he said,</p><h1>GOVERNOR PORCIUS FESTUS</h1><h4>you shall hear him.</h4><p>   <u>23</u>So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in. <u>24</u>Festus said,</p><h1>GOVERNOR PORCIUS FESTUS</h1><h4>King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer. <u>25</u>But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him. <u>26</u>Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have something to write. <u>27</u>For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to also specify the charges against him.</h4><p>   <strong>26</strong><u>1</u>Agrippa said to Paul,</p><h1>HEROD AGRIPPA</h1><h4>You may speak for yourself.</h4><p>   Then Paul stretched out his hand, and made his defense.</p><h1>PAUL</h1><h3><u>2</u>I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you today concerning all the things that I am accused by the Jews, <u>3</u>especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.<br />   <u>4</u>Indeed, all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem; <u>5</u>having known me from the first, if they are willing to testify, that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. <u>6</u>Now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers, <u>7</u>which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa! <u>8</u>Why is it judged incredible with you, if God does raise the dead?<br />   <u>9</u>I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. <u>10</u>This I also did in Jerusalem. I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them. <u>11</u>Punishing them often in all the synagogues, I tried to make them blaspheme. Being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.<br />   <u>12</u>Whereupon as I traveled to Damascus with the authority and commission from the chief priests, <u>13</u>at noon, O king, I saw on the way a light from the sky, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who traveled with me. <u>14</u>When we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’<br />   <u>15</u>I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’<br />   He said, ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. <u>16</u>But arise, and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of the things which I will reveal to you; <u>17</u>delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you, <u>18</u>to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’<br />   <u>19</u>Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, <u>20</u>but declared first to them of Damascus, at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance. <u>21</u>For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple, and tried to kill me. <u>22</u>Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would happen, <u>23</u>how the Christ must suffer, and how, by the resurrection of the dead, he would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles.</h3><p>   <u>24</u>As he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice,</p><h1>GOVERNOR PORCIUS FESTUS</h1><h4>Paul, you are crazy! Your great learning is driving you insane!</h4><p>   <u>25</u>But he said,</p><h1>PAUL</h1><h3>I am not crazy, most excellent Festus, but boldly declare words of truth and reasonableness. <u>26</u>For the king knows of these things, to whom also I speak freely. For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him, for this has not been done in a corner. <u>27</u>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.</h3><p>   <u>28</u>Agrippa said to Paul,</p><h1>HEROD AGRIPPA</h1><h4>With a little persuasion are you trying to make me a Christian?</h4><p>   <u>29</u>Paul said,</p><h1>PAUL</h1><h3>I pray to God, that whether with little or with much, not only you, but also all that hear me today, might become such as I am, except for these bonds.</h3><p>   <u>30</u>The king rose up with the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them. <u>31</u>When they had withdrawn, they spoke to one another, saying,</p><h1>ROMAN AUTHORITIES</h1><h4>This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</h4><p><u>32</u>Agrippa said to Festus,</p><h1>HEROD AGRIPPA</h1><h4>This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.</h4><h5>*Acts 23:23 about 9:00 PM<br />*Acts 24:6 TR adds “We wanted to judge him according to our law,”<br />*Acts 24:7 TR adds “but the commanding officer, Lysias, came by and with great violence took him out of our hands,”<br />*Acts 24:8 TR adds “commanding his accusers to come to you.”</h5>\",\"path\":\"/362\",\"Question1\":\"Paul gives his testimony twice in this passage.

Therefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have something to write. <u>27</u>For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to also specify the charges against him.</h4><p>   <strong>26</strong><u>1</u>Agrippa said to Paul,</p><h1>HEROD AGRIPPA</h1><h4>You may speak for yourself.</h4><p>   Then Paul stretched out his hand, and made his defense.</p><h1>PAUL</h1><h3><u>2</u>I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you today concerning all the things that I am accused by the Jews, <u>3</u>especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.<br />   <u>4</u>Indeed, all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem; <u>5</u>having known me from the first, if they are willing to testify, that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. <u>6</u>Now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers, <u>7</u>which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa! <u>8</u>Why is it judged incredible with you, if God does raise the dead?<br />   <u>9</u>I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. <u>10</u>This I also did in Jerusalem. I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them. <u>11</u>Punishing them often in all the synagogues, I tried to make them blaspheme. Being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.<br />   <u>12</u>Whereupon as I traveled to Damascus with the authority and commission from the chief priests, <u>13</u>at noon, O king, I saw on the way a light from the sky, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who traveled with me. <u>14</u>When we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’<br />   <u>15</u>I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’<br />   He said, ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. <u>16</u>But arise, and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of the things which I will reveal to you; <u>17</u>delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you, <u>18</u>to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’<br />   <u>19</u>Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, <u>20</u>but declared first to them of Damascus, at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance. <u>21</u>For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple, and tried to kill me. <u>22</u>Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would happen, <u>23</u>how the Christ must suffer, and how, by the resurrection of the dead, he would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles.</h3><p>   <u>24</u>As he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice,</p><h1>GOVERNOR PORCIUS FESTUS</h1><h4>Paul, you are crazy! Your great learning is driving you insane!</h4><p>   <u>25</u>But he said,</p><h1>PAUL</h1><h3>I am not crazy, most excellent Festus, but boldly declare words of truth and reasonableness. <u>26</u>For the king knows of these things, to whom also I speak freely. For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him, for this has not been done in a corner. <u>27</u>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.</h3><p>   <u>28</u>Agrippa said to Paul,</p><h1>HEROD AGRIPPA</h1><h4>With a little persuasion are you trying to make me a Christian?</h4><p>   <u>29</u>Paul said,</p><h1>PAUL</h1><h3>I pray to God, that whether with little or with much, not only you, but also all that hear me today, might become such as I am, except for these bonds.</h3><p>   <u>30</u>The king rose up with the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them. <u>31</u>When they had withdrawn, they spoke to one another, saying,</p><h1>ROMAN AUTHORITIES</h1><h4>This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</h4><p><u>32</u>Agrippa said to Festus,</p><h1>HEROD AGRIPPA</h1><h4>This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.</h4><h5>*Acts 23:23 about 9:00 PM<br />*Acts 24:6 TR adds “We wanted to judge him according to our law,”<br />*Acts 24:7 TR adds “but the commanding officer, Lysias, came by and with great violence took him out of our hands,”<br />*Acts 24:8 TR adds “commanding his accusers to come to you.”</h5>\",\"path\":\"/362\",\"Question1\":\"Paul gives his testimony twice in this passage.
