I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such as didn’t worship the beast nor his image, and didn’t receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand. They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. <u>5</u>The rest of the dead didn’t live until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. <u>6</u>Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over these, the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with him one thousand years.<br />   <u>7</u>And after the thousand years, Satan will be released from his prison, <u>8</u>and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. <u>9</u>They went up over the width of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints, and the beloved city. Fire came down out of heaven from God, and devoured them. <u>10</u>The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are also. They will be tormented day and night forever and ever.<br />   <u>11</u>I saw a great white throne, and him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. There was found no place for them. <u>12</u>I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and they opened books. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works. <u>13</u>The sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades* gave up the dead who were in them. They were judged, each one according to his works. <u>14</u>Death and Hades* were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. <u>15</u>If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.<br />   <strong>21</strong><u>1</u>I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away, and the sea is no more. <u>2</u>I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband. <u>3</u>I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Behold, God’s dwelling is with people, and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. <u>4</u>He will wipe away from them every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; neither will there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more. The first things have passed away.</h2><p>   <u>5</u>He who sits on the throne said,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Behold, I am making all things new.</h2><p>He said,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>Write, for these words of God are faithful and true.</h2><p><u>6</u>He said to me,</p><h1>GOD</h1><h2>It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give freely to him who is thirsty from the spring of the water of life. <u>7</u>He who overcomes, I will give him these things. I will be his God, and he will be my son. <u>8</u>But for the cowardly, unbelieving, sinners, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers,* idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.</h2><p>   <u>9</u>One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were loaded with the seven last plagues came, and he spoke with me, saying,</p><h1>ONE OF THE SEVEN ANGELS</h1><h4>Come here. I will show you the wife, the Lamb’s bride.</h4><p><u>10</u>He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, <u>11</u>having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, as if it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal; <u>12</u>having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel. <u>13</u>On the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. <u>14</u>The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb. <u>15</u>He who spoke with me had for a measure, a golden reed, to measure the city, its gates, and its walls. <u>16</u>The city is square, and its length is as great as its width. He measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand twelve stadia.* Its length, width, and height are equal. <u>17</u>Its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits,* by the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. <u>18</u>The construction of its wall was jasper. The city was pure gold, like pure glass. <u>19</u>The foundations of the city’s wall were adorned with all kinds of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire;* the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; <u>20</u>the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; and the twelfth, amethyst. <u>21</u>The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each one of the gates was made of one pearl. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. <u>22</u>I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb, are its temple. <u>23</u>The city has no need for the sun, neither of the moon, to shine, for the very glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb. <u>24</u>The nations will walk in its light. The kings of the earth bring the glory and honor of the nations into it. <u>25</u>Its gates will in no way be shut by day (for there will be no night there), <u>26</u>and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it so that they may enter. <u>27</u>There will in no way enter into it anything profane, or one who causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life.<br />   <strong>22</strong><u>1</u>He showed me a* river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, <u>2</u>in the middle of its street. On this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits, yielding its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. <u>3</u>There will be no curse any more. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants serve him. <u>4</u>They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. <u>5</u>There will be no night, and they need no lamp light; for the Lord God will illuminate them. They will reign forever and ever.<br />   <u>6</u>He said to me,</p><h1>A GUIDING ANGEL</h1><h4>These words are faithful and true. The Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his bondservants the things which must happen soon.</h4><h1>JESUS</h1><h2><u>7</u>Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.</h2><p>   <u>8</u>Now I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. When I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things. <u>9</u>He said to me,</p><h1>A GUIDING ANGEL</h1><h4>See you don’t do it! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers, the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.</h4><p><u>10</u>He said to me,</p><h1>A GUIDING ANGEL</h1><h4>Don’t seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand. <u>11</u>He who acts unjustly, let him act unjustly still. He who is filthy, let him be filthy still. He who is righteous, let him do righteousness still. He who is holy, let him be holy still</h4><h1>JESUS</h1><h2><u>12</u>Behold, I come quickly. My reward is with me, to repay to each man according to his work. <u>13</u>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. <u>14</u>Blessed are those who do his commandments,* that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city. <u>15</u>Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. <u>16</u>I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the assemblies. I am the root and the offspring of David; the Bright and Morning Star.</h2><p>   <u>17</u>The Spirit and the bride say,</p><h1>THE HOLY SPIRIT &amp; THE BRIDE OF THE LAMB</h1><h2>Come!</h2><p>He who hears, let him say,</p><h1>ALL WHO HEAR</h1><h4>Come!</h4><p>He who is thirsty, let him come. He who desires, let him take the water of life freely. <u>18</u>I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, if anyone adds to them, may God add to him the plagues which are written in this book. <u>19</u>If anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, may God take away his part from the tree* of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book. <u>20</u>He who testifies these things says,</p><h1>JESUS</h1><h2>Yes, I come quickly.</h2><p>   Amen! Yes, come, Lord Jesus.<br />   <u>21</u>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with all the saints. Amen.</p><h5>*Revelation 20:13 or, Hell<br />*Revelation 20:14 or, Hell<br />*Revelation 21:8 The word for “sorcerers” here also includes users of potions and drugs.<br />*Revelation 21:16 12,012 stadia = or 2,221 kilometers or 1,380 miles.
