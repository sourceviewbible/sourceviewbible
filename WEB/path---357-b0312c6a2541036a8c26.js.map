From there they sailed to Cyprus. <u>5</u>When they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. They had also John as their attendant. <u>6</u>When they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar Jesus, <u>7</u>who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God. <u>8</u>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith. <u>9</u>But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him, <u>10</u>and said,</p><h1>PAUL</h1><h3>Full of all deceit and all cunning, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? <u>11</u>Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season!</h3><p>   Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him. He went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand. <u>12</u>Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.<br />   <u>13</u>Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem. <u>14</u>But they, passing on from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down. <u>15</u>After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying,</p><h1>SYNAGOGUE LEADERS</h1><h4>Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, speak.</h4><p>   <u>16</u>Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said,</p><h1>PAUL</h1><h3>Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen. <u>17</u>The God of this people* chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they stayed as aliens in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, he led them out of it. <u>18</u>For a period of about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. <u>19</u>When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred fifty years. <u>20</u>After these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. <u>21</u>Afterward they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. <u>22</u>When he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, to whom he also testified, ‘I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.’ <u>23</u>From this man’s offspring,* God has brought salvation* to Israel according to his promise, <u>24</u>before his coming, when John had first preached the baptism of repentance to Israel.* <u>25</u>As John was fulfilling his course, he said, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. But behold, one comes after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.’ <u>26</u>Brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, the word of this salvation is sent out to you. <u>27</u>For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they didn’t know him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him. <u>28</u>Though they found no cause for death, they still asked Pilate to have him killed. <u>29</u>When they had fulfilled all things that were written about him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb. <u>30</u>But God raised him from the dead, <u>31</u>and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people. <u>32</u>We bring you good news of the promise made to the fathers, <u>33</u>that God has fulfilled the same to us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second psalm,<br />   ‘You are my Son.<br />   Today I have become your father.’*<br />   <u>34</u>Concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he has spoken thus: ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.’* <u>35</u>Therefore he says also in another psalm, ‘You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.’* <u>36</u>For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw decay. <u>37</u>But he whom God raised up saw no decay. <u>38</u>Be it known to you therefore, brothers,* that through this man is proclaimed to you remission of sins, <u>39</u>and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses. <u>40</u>Beware therefore, lest that come on you which is spoken in the prophets:<br />   <u>41</u>‘Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish;<br />   for I work a work in your days,<br />   a work which you will in no way believe, if one declares it to you.’*</h3><p>   <u>42</u>So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath. <u>43</u>Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God. <u>44</u>The next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God. <u>45</u>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.<br />   <u>46</u>Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said,</p><h1>PAUL & BARNABAS</h1><h3>It was necessary that God’s word should be spoken to you first.

As many as were appointed to eternal life believed. <u>49</u>The Lord’s word was spread abroad throughout all the region. <u>50</u>But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their borders. <u>51</u>But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium. <u>52</u>The disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit.<br />   <strong>14</strong><u>1</u>In Iconium, they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed. <u>2</u>But the disbelieving* Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers. <u>3</u>Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. <u>4</u>But the multitude of the city was divided. Part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles. <u>5</u>When some of both the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers, made a violent attempt to mistreat and stone them, <u>6</u>they became aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and the surrounding region. <u>7</u>There they preached the Good News.<br />   <u>8</u>At Lystra a certain man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked. <u>9</u>He was listening to Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole, <u>10</u>said with a loud voice,</p><h1>PAUL</h1><h3>Stand upright on your feet!</h3><p>He leaped up and walked. <u>11</u>When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia,</p><h1>THE PEOPLE OF LYSTRA</h1><h4>The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!</h4><p><u>12</u>They called Barnabas “Jupiter”, and Paul “Mercury”, because he was the chief speaker. <u>13</u>The priest of Jupiter, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes. <u>14</u>But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and sprang into the multitude, crying out,</p><h1>PAUL &amp; BARNABAS</h1><h3><u>15</u>Men, why are you doing these things?
