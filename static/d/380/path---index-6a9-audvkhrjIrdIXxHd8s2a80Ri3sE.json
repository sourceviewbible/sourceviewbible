Some take an arduously long time! The longer one works on a goal or the more one invests in a project, the more one enjoys the sense of accomplishment at it's conclusion. Over these days we’ve considered the words spoken in far distant times anticipating the coming of the Messiah. We’ve read portions of Scripture dating back to the days of:</p><ul><li>Isaiah (Days 3, 6, 9 and 10) in the 7th century bc,</li><li>Micah (Day 4) overlapping the 8th and 7th centuries bc,</li><li>Hosea (Day 7) in the 8th century bc,</li><li>David (Day 2) in the10th century bc,</li><li>Eli (Day 8) in the 11th century bc,</li><li>Moses (Day 4) in the 14th century bc, and</li><li>Jacob (Day 1) some 19 centuries before Christ.</li></ul><p>   The anticipation for this day had been building for centuries. The hope ran deep. Countless people over myriads of generations had lifted up prayers to God for this day. “Send us a deliverer, Lord”, they prayed. “Come, God, with your Messiah!” How could we ever measure the intensity of passion behind all these accumulated hopes and prayers?<br/>   But our human longing for the coming deliverance pales alongside what must have been going on in the heart of God. Paul, writing to Timothy, states that it was God’s “plan from before the beginning of time—to show us his grace through Christ Jesus” (2Ti 1:9). When he wrote Titus, he likewise said that God had promised eternal life through the advent of Jesus “before the world began” (Tit 1:1-3). We can’t even begin to imagine how long ago that was! How could we ever imagine all the anticipation built up in God’s heart? Certainly the angels must have sensed the divine longing, for when the moment finally arrived, they could not contain themselves. On that night of nights, they burst forth into song! The moment had come. The Messiah had arrived.<br/>   The timing couldn’t have been better. Paul writes, “But when the right time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, subject to the law. God sent him to buy freedom for us who were slaves to the law, so that he could adopt us as his very own children. And because we are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, prompting us to call out, ‘Abba, Father.’ Now you are no longer a slave but God’s own child. And since you are his child, God has made you his heir” (Gal 4:4-7).<br/>   What an amazing thing! His advent made it all possible. Certainly, it was a night worthy of angelic songs!
